Economic RESET is a mathematical certainty. Do we RESET the global system of systems as is or do we re-engineer our world using NATO / DOD system of systems engineering framework standing on the shoulders of giants (Edison, Lietaer, Friedman) swords to plowshares? 

IF climate change causes a drop in crop commodities by 20–25 % while population grows, THEN this condition will become a matter of national security. THEN this will require revisiting Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer’s TRC Trade Reference Currency ELSE face chaos by not leveraging proven system of systems & tactics. 

USPTO 13/573,002 is an Adaptive Procedural Template supports Distributed Trade Federation / Organizations with DoD / NATO system of systems engineering signaling, telemetry framework and syntax OPSCODE brevity codes matched with 2525C symbol sets vital for A.I. man-machine interface, interoperability, consistency and consensus

BACKGROUND: Nobel Prize Winning Economist Milton Friedman: “Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.” ― Milton Friedman

BACKGROUND: Given food, fertilizer shortages (wheat, sunflower, soybean... baby formula...), energy, fuel prices and looming fuel rationing, it logically follows that the world has no other options than to organize both micro (local) and macro (global) economies observing space - time conservative SLA Service Level Agreements where closer = cheaper given closer = less fuel, time resources used to produce, ship.. Demurrage fees incentivize conservation of resources, commodities i.e., discounts for locally produced, consumed goods and commodities. It is TIME.

Question: what constitutes foundation tech for #DeFi / programmable $$$ ? Teams are forming to win the DeFi Distributed Finance / programmable $$$ - money IP Intellectual Property wars. The winning team will prove that their IP intellectual property filings establishes / established FOUNDATION TECHNOLOGY. Question: What is foundation tech given the SCOTUS 2014 "Alice in Wonderland" ruling?

THESIS: All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:
1.	Time epochs created by oscillating quartz crystal silicon chips
2.	Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles

THESIS SUMMARY: All things internet, net of money blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast protocols. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast and workflow filters. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Internet 3.0 and the new web will be based on the original structure described by Stanford University. There are no packets, frames, layers, blocks, shards, graphs, hash graphs “bots”, “motes”, … or Satoshi's traversing the net, stored in a blockchain cube. Transactions are unicast, multicast, or anycast (workflow). The afore mention terms are non-existent fabrication.

The above cited memes made up terms are non - compliant US Supreme Court SCOTUS Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank 2014 ruling “claims may not direct towards abstract ideas”, Note: Physical is the opposite of abstract considering SCOTUS Alice 2014 ruling and in light of the fact that NIST’s National Institute of Standards and Technology QRNB Quantum Random Number Beacon is based on light photonics.

3.4 Outputs: USPTO 13/573,002 aids in establishing consistency, interoperability, temporal synchronization and stochastic harmonization among myriad consensus algorithm memes, and metaphors under constant development and change
3.5 Methods Specific activities depend on the type of use case. However, all use cases are iterative and follow the design of adaptive procedural templates – see detailed treatise (s)

3.5.1 METHOD 1: A systemic, adaptive, procedural template method used to improve synchronization in metrics, metering using </Org_ID>, {“URN”} XML data tags in signaling during heartbeat micro-cycles prior to data fusion center entry consisting of iterative heartbeat cycle metrics, meters reporting where state meta data heartbeat snapshot recalculations are performed at off site connectors that are signaling relays performing recalculation, syntax processing during macro-cycle epochs reconciling dissimilar standards, data syntax formats that are then reported signaled, news casted, beacon broadcasted to distributed organization applique overlay displays

3.5.2 METHOD 2. An adaptive procedural template used to improve signaling, synchronization, stochastic harmonization across UTZ Universal Time Zones using TCP/IP heartbeat time stamping occurring during micro-cycles of state meta data prior to data fusion center entry among metrics, metering processes comprised of TCP/IP heartbeats, heartbeat messages signaled during micro-cycles scheduling instructions, commands, processes, procedures, algorithms, telemetry instructions for example, to master-controller processes i.e., block, start, stop, pause, resume, set Time To live TTL i.e., stock market high frequency flash trade, currency, interest rates, tax rates, time banking, cloud computing commodity exchanges, big data, electrical micro-grid, fungible goods, real time bidding, many use cases. Summary: Time stamping and applying descriptive data type tags to heartbeat state meta data after data is collected and queued, stored in temporary structures or entered into data base instantiations after the fact is problematic. All internet supported devices including high frequency stock, currency, commodity etc., flash trade master controllers receive heartbeats. System Heartbeats are intervals, epoch time cycles used to (not) process syntax.

3.5.3 METHOD 3 A systemic adaptive procedural template method improving stochastic networks harmonization through use of timing, synchronization intrinsic to TCP/IP heartbeat / heartbeat message signaling using set, scheduled, epochs in micro-cycles in combination with firefly insect signaling stochastic harmonization algorithms where firefly protocol sample means are matched with closest heartbeat sync delta micro-cycle report values to recalculate statistical averages, means signaled through off site connector conversion, recalculation gateways that news-cast, beacon broadcast to subscribers monitoring macro-cycle reports that heretofore would not exist without following the Heart Beacon Cycle procedural template as guides for reporting thus improving temporal harmonization in metrics and metering of stochastic telecommunication mesh fabrics grid control planes over wide areas in cases involving issues in terms of consistency, reliability, traceability, positive organizational identification, temporal transaction fidelity, event, alert predictability, data analytics, network forensics real rime bidding, stock market exchange floor server co-location verses servers distantly located, fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchanges, double payment adjudication, fungible good trading stochastic harmonization, electrical power micro-grids, cloud computing, "big data"...

Use cases: network moves, adds, joins, splits, drops used instead of merger, acquisition

3.5.5 METHOD 5. A systemic adaptive procedural template method improving search engine methods using heartbeat, beacon signaling, <ORG_ID>, , <class_types>, Paul Revere, water drop in pond meme metric recalculations occurring at offsite connectors, conversion relay gateways where detection of trigger point function recalculations of state meta data set aggregations are used to detect threshold fluctuations by resource , , quantity, availability duration etc., further used to improve geo-spatial temporal descriptive mapping methods, changes in clusters of objects, entities, artifacts i.e., location, epoch time stamp geo-spatially, temporally, used to locate, search, then group into virtual collections using <data_tags> i.e., in spatial econometric, volumetric operations within network mesh fabrics triggering news-casting invitations to join equitably metered federated group arbitrage events, activities that are triggered by internet search operations improving collaboration, metrics and metering in for example, commodity, fungibles trading, resource pooling, crowd sourcing, economics.

3.5.6 Method 6: Physical linear – sequential “Paul Revere” meme used to represent TCP/IP internet “hops” that are abstractions ineligible for patent protection. Water drop in pond physical metaphor describes geospatial temporal intensity in omni-directional, circle, radius type situations. Naval sonar water drop in pond USPTO 13/573,002 meme explains geo-spatial temporal intensity metrics, meters using a physical metaphor. TCP/IP “ping” is an abstraction as are “packets”, “frames”, “hops”, “Satoshi’s” as data stores in a cryptocurrency “blockchain” (distributed database)

3.5.7 METHOD 7. A systemic adaptive procedural template method used to improve handicapped / information alerts, events, methods reliant on heartbeat timing, signaling synchronization of state meta-data improved using Paul Revere, water drop in pond memes to create, calculate radius, intensity metrics viewed as geo-spatial, temporal intensity effects i.e., visual light bar tabs i.e., stock exchange candlestick charts, audible tone, vibration-tactile situational awareness alerts by correlating tone based messaging precedence XML where lower / higher precedence settings equate to lower / higher audible tones, tactile vibrations for deaf where fewer / greater number of light tabs lit correlates, corresponds to priority, precedence further used in alert triggers of threshold fluctuations displayed in appliqué overlay graphics as metrics, meters. Reference: Describes reuse of structured military messaging’s precedence system to support for example, processing of Named Data Networking distance, interest packets by numeric precedence. This method is effective among machine to machine (Internet of Things).

3.5.8 METHOD 8. A systemic, adaptive procedural template method using heartbeat signaling, time stamp record keeping processes of state meta data described, typed by organizations, resources typed by Uniform Resource Name, further improved through use of Paul Revere, Water Drop in Pond memes to quantify, describe unused resources with unmet needs by performing recalculations of state meta-data snapshot artifacts occurring at offsite connector conversion gateways where micro-cycle reports from local, micro-cycle activities are signaled, relayed to higher echelon organizations monitoring macro-cycles who are interested in for example stock market "pools” where "output" is correlated and displayed onto appliqué views of aggregate sync delta changes in macro-micro economics recalculations, stocks, commodities, currencies, interest rates, electric micro-grids, currency (Terra) exchanges, spatial econometrics, contributory economics. Syntax code language parsed, processed during silicon chip generated time cycles forms all things internet, internet of money.

3.5.9 Method 9: Method / Claim describes the military’s network centric operations systems of systems method of collecting state meta data sync delta heartbeat snapshot data during operational micro-cycles that is then summed, aggregated, disseminated and displayed during macro-cycles as part of Network Enabled Operations NEO situation awareness system of systems engineering best practice over time

3.6 Outputs: State meta data collected from a current micro-cycle to the next and from many micro-cycles summed, aggregated to report during macro-cycle reporting periods are stored, collected in the off-site collector depicted by that corresponding workflow symbol. See detailed treatise on workflow, workflow symbols for example https://edrawsoft.com/flowchart-symbols.php

3.7 Verification and Validation See detailed treatise (s) on Verification and Validation

3.8 Exit Criteria: Organizations may elect to tether, untether to the Distributed Autonomous Organization based federation at their discretion (maintain autonomy) or organizations may be disconnected if they fail to observe federation rules

3.9 Metrics: Use of physical metaphors such as the water drop in pond, Paul Revere metaphor comply with Supreme Court Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank ruling claims may not direct towards abstract ideas. See figure twelve, USPTO application 13/573,002 main embodiment. Metrics are based on epoch time cycles as the only actual option

Invention’s focus is economic micro-macro cycles. However, the invention initially focused on emergency first response under the name “Heartbeat e9-1-1”. Many use cases are supported. Internet “packets” “frames” “datagrams” are metaphors and memes ineligible for patent protection. Inventors use Little League Baseball memes and 3 x 5 index cards to describe messages, syntax, code as instructions that are processed during silicon chip created time cycles

1.	Background

The term Distributed Autonomous Organization DAO was created by a military think tank RAND Corporation circa 2001. This term is being reused by organizations describing cryptocurrency blockchain technology. USPTO 13,573,002’s method is protocol, technology neutral. Use cases focus on the cryptocurrency blockchain. For example, many message oriented middleware products use message event bus strategies. USPTO 13/573,002 reuses and improves upon military Network Centric Warfare best practice of organizing individuals in groups geo-spatially distributed across distances and UTZ time zones i.e., micro – macro cycle scheduling, use of organizational, resource identifiers via structured data exchanges is reused / improved through use of algorithms which are essentially workflow rules and math for example. 

1.1	Adaptive Procedural Template = checklist of useful tools, procedures…	

Use adaptive, procedural templates to aid individuals join trade federations. Affiliated organizations are geo-spatially, temporally located in distributed, dispersed locations across time – space. Member organizations may join or leave in an adhoc, agile manner to take advantage or react to events, situations while retaining autonomy or the ability to act on one’s own behalf, control one’s own activities, The process involves agile, adhoc joins, merges, drops to / from federation in lieu of formal merger, and acquisition

1.2	Scope	

Trade federations form among local communities or among sovereign (First) nations. The off-site connector workflow object convention connects, mitigates, adjusts by summation, statistical mean by aggregation among federated, non-federated groups acting as format gateways among participating, non – participating groups. 

1.3	Roles	

For example, the baseball umpire meme is the rule observer / enforcer i.e., the cryptocurrency blockchain segregated witness observer. The baseball game statistician performs data analytics e.g., time series database maintainer, the base runner delivers (code syntax) instructions via 3 x 5 cards. Base running forms blocks on blockchain that is represented by the baseball diamond when stood up on its home plate corner in 3d embodies a cube that has length, width, depth height = volume, Little League Tournament board votes on most valuable player in voting functions.

APPENDIX B: USPTO 13/573,002 CLAIMS: 

1. A systemic, adaptive, procedural template method used to improve synchronization in metrics, metering using </Org_ID>, {“URN”} XML data tags in signaling during heartbeat micro-cycles prior to data fusion center entry consisting of iterative heartbeat cycle metrics, meters reporting where state meta data heartbeat snapshot recalculations are performed at off site connectors that are signaling relays performing recalculation, syntax processing during macro-cycle epochs reconciling dissimilar standards, data syntax formats that are then reported signaled, news casted, beacon broadcasted to distributed organization applique overlay displays

Summary: Syntax code language parsed, processed during silicon chip generated time cycles forms all things internet, internet of money. Claim describes the military’s network centric operations systems of systems method of collecting state meta data sync delta heartbeat snapshot data during operational micro-cycles that is then summed, aggregated, disseminated and displayed during macro-cycles as part of Network Enabled Operations NEO situation awareness system of systems engineering. USPTO vetted application for National security.

2.

Summary: Physical linear – sequential “Paul Revere” meme used given TCP/IP internet “hops” are abstractions ineligible for patent protect. Water drop in pond physical metaphor describes geospatial temporal intensity in omni-directional, circle, radius type situations. Naval sonar meme explains geo-spatial temporal intensity metrics, meters. TCP/IP “ping” is an abstraction.

6. A systemic adaptive procedural template method used to improve handicapped / information alerts, events, methods reliant on heartbeat timing, signaling synchronization of state meta-data improved using Paul Revere, water drop in pond memes to create, calculate radius, intensity metrics viewed as geo-spatial, temporal intensity effects i.e., visual light bar tabs i.e., stock exchange candlestick charts, audible tone, vibration-tactile situational awareness alerts by correlating tone based messaging precedence XML <tag> where lower / higher precedence settings equate to lower / higher audible tones, tactile vibrations for deaf where fewer / greater number of light tabs lit correlates, corresponds to priority, precedence <tags> further used in 
alert triggers of threshold fluctuations displayed in appliqué overlay graphics as metrics, meters. Describes reuse of structured military messaging’s precedence system to support for example, processing of Named Data Networking distance, interest packets by numeric precedence for example, among Internet of Everything / Things

7. A systemic, adaptive procedural template method using heartbeat signaling, time stamp record keeping processes of state meta data described, typed by organizations, resources typed by Uniform Resource Name, further improved through use of Paul Revere, Water Drop in Pond memes to quantify, describe unused resources with unmet needs by performing recalculations of state meta-data snapshot artifacts occurring at off site connector conversion gateways where 
micro-cycle reports from local, micro-cycle activities are signaled, relayed to higher echelon organizations monitoring macro-cycles who are interested in for example stock market "pools” where "output" is correlated and displayed onto appliqué views of aggregate sync delta changes in macro-micro economic recalculations, stocks, commodities, currencies, interest rates, electric micro-grids, currency (Terra) exchanges, spatial econometrics, contributory economics. Claim highlights ‘off site connector” that is a workflow convention as the method where for example, trade federation “A” interfaces with organization (s), nation states, Economic Unions EU that may or may not observe the same conventions, rules, methods

Invention’s focus is economic micro-macro cycles. However, the invention initially focused on emergency first response under the name “Heartbeat e9-1-1”. Many use cases are supported. Internet “packets” “frames” “datagrams” are metaphors and memes ineligible for patent protection. Inventors use Little League Baseball memes and 3 x 5 index cards to describe messages, syntax, code as instructions that are processed during silicon chip created time cycles

Internet, internet of money artifacts are created using silicon chip created time cycles to process / not process code syntax as instructions. Following the military’s structured military messaging method where numbered messages and message sets for the basis to describe state meta data in compact, concise, efficient terms that will help unify, standardize coding. Military operational methods, discipline used to schedule, synchronize, organize DAO Distributed Autonomous Organizations across time-space reused in other use cases improves synchronicity

BLOCKCHAIN DISTRIBUTED LEDGER: provides a tamper-proof data structure, providing a shared public ledger open to all. The mathematics involved are impressive, and the use of specialized hardware to construct this vast chain of cryptographic data renders it practically impossible to replicate. All transactions are embedded in the bitcoin blockchain. Use of SHA-256 cryptography ensures the integrity of the blockchain applications – all transactions must be signed using a private key or seed, which prevents third parties from tampering with it. Transactions are confirmed by the network within 10 minutes or so and this process is handled by bitcoin miners. Mining is used to confirm transactions through a shared consensus system, and usually requires several independent confirmations for the transaction to go through. This process guarantees random distribution and makes tampering very difficult.

CASPER PoC3 Blockchain BACKBONE: Casper is a security-deposit based economic consensus protocol. Nodes, as “bonded validators”, have to place a security deposit (action called “bonding”) in order to serve the consensus by producing blocks. The protocol’s direct control of these security deposits is the primary way in which Casper affects the incentives of validators. Specifically, if a validator produces anything that Casper considers “invalid”, their deposit is forfeited along with the privilege of participating in the consensus process. The use of security deposits addresses the “nothing at stake” problem; that behaving badly is not expensive. When something is at stake, bonded validators who misbehave in an objectively verifiable manner will lose it.

CEILIOMETER, GNOCCHI, PANDA: builds metering around a data structure called samples. A sample is generated each time Ceilometer measures something. It is composed of a few fields, such as the resource id that is metered, the user and project ID owning resources, the meter name, the measured value, a timestamp and a few free-form metadata. Each time Ceilometer measures something, one of its components (an agent, a pollster…) constructs and emits a sample headed for the storage component called the collector. The collector is responsible for storing samples into a database. The Ceilometer collector uses a pluggable storage system usable with any database 
  
Ceilometer REST API allows executing various reading requests on the data store. It returns the list of resources that have been measured for a particular project, or computes statistics on metrics. Source: https://dzone.com/articles/openstack-ceilometer

Ericsson Patents Open Money for Society 20130166398 “System And Method For Implementing A Context Based Payment System.” https://letstalkbitcoin.com/ericsson-patents-open-money-for-society "It is our vision that one day everyone with access to a mobile phone will be able to spend, send and receive money as easily as sending a text via SMS." "When money is open, the way we send, spend and receive money will change forever."

"Local producers are sometimes forced to price goods relative to distant competition, and, because of lower production and wage costs in different parts of the world (or even country), substantially lower profit margins can be the result. There are times, however, when consumers might be willing to buy locally produced goods for the good of the society {Emphasis LTB}, and that attitude is more prevalent today than in the past. But what a consumer says they will do, and what actually occurs in practical, real shopping situations can be significantly different. Faced with competitive quality products, but disparate prices, the consumer often feels that he or she has no real choice, especially if budgets are more constrained because of uncertain economic conditions, and therefore are not what they used to be. Thus, personal economic pressures can hinder "good" buying decisions. Retailers too are cognizant of an increased awareness for the value of locally produced products. They market local producers and even arrange special sections with "good" products, i.e., those that minimally impact the environment both in terms of environmentally friendly manufacturing methods, but also those articles that have been produced locally." "Thus, current economic conditions, and prevailing economic theories make it difficult, if not impossible, for an average consumer to make an impact on the local economy and the local environment, regardless of their attitudes. Therefore, we provide methods for creating a context based payment system.

Patent Abstract: "Disclosed herein is a context-based payment system. Electronic currency or coupons can be made dependent on context, and the context can be one of location or geography, time, date, distance, sound, or other devices. The value of the currency exists only if a pre-condition is fulfilled. For example, if the currency is location dependent, the value only exists in a defined area (currency value area). The goods or the service in the value-system are also context dependent, that is, they can only be sold or offered in a defined area (product value area). Accordingly, if the product value area and the currency value area overlap, a purchase and payment can be made."

FEDERATION (CLOUD COMPUTING): FEDERATION: from Latin: foedus, gen.: foederis, covenant characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, are typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body.  Individuals, organizations retain AUTONOMY to act on their own behalf. Federation: reuse of military System of Systems research, best practice guiding formation of a procedural template framework is key to forming and maintaining sustainable Trade Federations as Distributed Autonomous Organizations DAO's / DAC's Corporations. Military's organize individuals into organizations <OrgID> and Organizational Units <OU><OU><OU> dispersed autonomous groups working on collective goals synchronized in time-space

Federate: Within a federated system, an organization needs a standardized and repeatable way of describing services it makes available to teams in leagues and policies by which it runs its operations. Federated identities within groups retain their autonomy, ability to act on their own behalf. Organization Identifiers </ORG IDs> represents a business, non-profit corporation, or government entity in the American Registry of Internet Numbers ARIN database. Entities may have more than one <Org_ID> for contingency planning. More than one ORG_ID enables business contingency plans for different scenarios, use cases, different circumstances. 

Federated Identity Management: federation describes the organization arrangements necessary for interconnection between teams, leagues, and commissions joined to achieve common goals. Federated systems need to interoperate across organizational boundaries and connect processes utilizing different technologies, identity storage, security approaches and programming models. Resources available to the group include the health or availability of individuals forming groups where monitoring is performed to ascertain if groups are mission capable or not in context with available resources and whether the group’s location is within a pre-defined geo-spatial range of a given activity or event. A federation describes the organization arrangements necessary for linkage between teams, leagues, and commissions joined to achieve common goals. Operations are performed as part of group’s activities. If trade is deemed non-equitable, groups, individuals may leave the trade federation as a network drop until conditions change or the individuals change their minds and decide to re-affiliate, re-tether to the collective.

FIREFLY-HEARTBEAT ALGORITHM UNIVERSITY of BOLOGNA / HUNGARY: Firefly inspired Heartbeat Synchronization: in a paper entitled Fireﬂy-inspired Heartbeat Synchronization in Overlay Networks by the University of Bologna and Trento Italy along with the University of Szeged, Hungary: “Heartbeat synchronization strives to have nodes in a distributed system generate periodic, local “heartbeat” events approximately at the same time. Many useful distributed protocols rely on the existence of such heartbeats for driving their cycle- based execution. The heartbeat synchronization protocol for overlay networks is inspired by mathematical models of ﬂash synchronization in certain species of ﬁre ﬂies. Nodes send ﬂash messages to their neighbors when a local heartbeat triggers. Fireflies adjust the phase of their next heartbeat based on incoming ﬂash messages using an algorithm inspired by mathematical models of ﬁre-ﬂy synchronization. Heartbeat synchronization strives to have nodes in a distributed system generate periodic, local “heartbeat” events approximately at the same time. It differs from classical clock synchronization in that nodes are not interested in counting cycles and agreeing on a ID of a current cycle. There is no requirement regarding the length of a cycle with respect to real time as long as a length is bounded and all nodes agree on it eventually. The goal is to guarantee that all nodes start and end their cycles at the same time, with an error that is at least one, but preferably more, orders of magnitude smaller than a chosen cycle length.
Firefly heartbeat synchronization reduces uncertainty in stochastic networks.

HADOOP: Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters.

Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology that has been described as an alternative to blockchains. The hashgraph technology is currently patented, and the only authorized ledger is Hedera Hashgraph. The native cryptocurrency of the Hedera Hashgraph system is HBAR.
Unlike blockchains, hashgraphs do not bundle data into blocks or use miners to validate transactions. Instead, hashgraphs use a "gossip about gossip" protocol where the individual nodes on the network "gossip" about transactions to create directed acyclic graphs that time-sequence transactions.[1] Each "gossip" message contains one or more transactions plus a timestamp, a digital signature, and cryptographic hashes of two earlier events. This makes Hashgraph form an asynchronous Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (aBFT) consensus algorithm.[2] Hashgraph was invented by the American computer scientist Leemon Baird. Baird is the co-founder and chief technical officer of Swirlds, a company that holds hashgraph algorithm patents

Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is a type of smart contract used in blockchain applications. It reduces counterparty risk by creating a time-based escrow that requires a cryptographic passphrase for unlocking. In practical terms, this means that the person receiving the funds in a transaction has to perform two actions to access the funds: enter the correct passphrase and claim payment within a specific timeframe. If they enter an incorrect passphrase or do not claim the funds within the timeframe, they lose access to the payment. A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) reduces counterparty risk in decentralized smart contracts by effectively creating a time-based escrow that utilizes a cryptographic passphrase. This type of smart contract requires the receiver of a payment to acknowledge it within a certain period of time or forfeit it. HTLCs is a fundamental tool used by the lightning network.

World Financial Standard ISO 20022 is a multi part International Standard prepared by ISO Technical Committee TC68 Financial Services. It describes a common platform for the development of messages in ASN.1 Abstract Syntax Notation: A single standardisation approach (methodology, process, repository) to be used by all financial standards initiatives. It is a common platform for the development of messages using:
- a modelling methodology to capture in a syntax-independent way financial business areas, business transactions and associated message flows
- a central dictionary of business items used in financial communications
- a set of XML and ASN.1 design rules to convert the message models into XML or ASN.1 schemas, whenever the use of the ISO 20022 XML or ASN.1-based syntax is preferred. 
The resulting models and derived messages are published in the Catalogue of messages and stored in the ISO 20022 Financial Repository available on this website. This flexible framework allows communities of users and message development organizations to define message sets according to an internationally agreed approach using internationally agreed business semantics and, whenever desirable, to migrate to the use of a common XML or ASN.1-based syntax.

MONEYBALL ECONOMICS: Sabermetrics, or Moneyball, is the practice of crunching data in an effort to build a stronger and smarter team without needing to go after the rock stars of the sport who may cost a team millions. This method holds that the skill of individual players isn’t what makes or breaks a team; in the long run, the goal is to make sure that each necessary skill is accounted for, whether by one player or four. The team will work like a clock, with each cog serving its own purpose (no matter how hopeless they may be at another area).. crafting a team while staying within a meager budget.

NAMED DATA NETWORKING NDN NEXT GENERATION INTERNET: Named-data networking focus is on content caching to reduce congestion and improve delivery speed, simpler configuration of network devices, and building security into the network at the data level. Types of Packets: Communication in NDN is driven by receivers i.e., data consumers, through the exchange of two types of packets: Interest and Data. Both types of packets carry a name that identiﬁes a piece of data transmitted in one Data packet. Overview of the Packet Contents for NDN Packet:

NAMED DATA NETWORK INTEREST: A consumer puts name of a desired piece of data into an Interest packet and sends it to network. Routers use name to forward Interest query toward data producer(s). Data: Once Interest packet reaches a node that has the requested data, the node will return a Data packet that contains both the name and the content, together with a signature by the producer’s key which binds the two. This Data packet follows in reverse the path taken by requesting consumer’s interest.

OPCODE: TURING COMPLETE SCRIPTING LANGUAGE: In computing, an opcode (abbreviated from operation code) is the portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed. Beside the opcode itself, instructions usually specify the data they will process, in form of operands. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode

OPERAND PROGRAMMABLE MONEY: Operand - “In mathematics, an operand is the object of a mathematical operation, a quantity on which an operation is performed.”
“In computing, an operand is the part of a computer instruction that specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.”

In Operand, the transactional unit carries the execution methods and parameters that apply to the units of currency involved for that transaction. Operand is programmable money that brings the utility of everyday banking features to the unbanked and underbanked and empowers their adoption through the automata of the Operand protocol. Operand is a currency that functions as a seamless and embedded economic layer on the web that serves as the technological underlay for payments, decentralized exchange, digital asset invocation and transfer, and smart contract issuance and execution. By embedding the instruction set of the transaction into the transaction metadata, the blockchain itself serves as the interpreter for programmed transactions. Operand creates utilities such as direct debit payments or even standing orders. Operand is trustless and non-retractable whilst being fully accountable and transparent on the public ledger. The programmable aspect enables further security on every transaction as the clients must reach network consensus on the method of execution. Smart contracts can then be forged on all aspects of exchange.

ROSETTA STONE SYNTAX LIBRARY LEXICON CODE GUIDE REGISTRY
The Rosetta Stone is a rock stele, found in 1799, inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V. The decree appears in three scripts: the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the middle portion is Demotic script, and the lowest is Ancient Greek. Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts (with some minor differences among them), the stone provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs. It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, and it aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic language. Lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholars.
Rosetta Stone concept in context with this project: a common syntax library and ability to convert <tags> to YAML indents to binary XML to various other Message Text Formats MTF to enable universal signaling / telemetry among a system of systems is needed. Structured messaging will help accelerate the process of organizing syntax into categories and forming syntax from disparate systems into template libraries simply because numbers are universal – text and symbols less so. Structured military messaging involves identifying use cases as messages and message sets commonly used to accomplish tasks that are identified by number. Data elements or Field Form Identifiers Reference Numbers or FFIRNS and Field Unit Designators as three and four digit codes unambiguously identify the use of the data element in number forms. Three and four digit codes in turn refer to text descriptions referencing symbols in symbol libraries / databases.  Messages are processed, parsed in - out of distributed database.

RANDOM NUMBER BEACON NIST:  uses two independent commercially available sources of randomness, each with an independent hardware entropy source and SP 800-90-approved components. The Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability, autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are made available by the source. Autonomy means that the source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a set of users can access the source all receiving the same random string. The Beacon broadcasts full-entropy bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds. Each value is time-stamped and signed and includes the hash of the previous value to chain the sequence of values together. This prevents all, even the source, from retroactively changing an output packet without being detected. The beacon keeps all output packets and makes them available online. http://nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/nist_beacon.cfm

TRADE REFERENCE CURRENCY TERRA TRC: Terra (The Trade Reference Currency, TRC) is the name of a possible "world currency". The concept was proposed by Belgian economist and expert on monetary systems Bernard A. Lietaer in 2001, based on a similar proposal from the 1930s.The currency is meant to be based on a basket of the 9-12 most important commodities (according to their importance in worldwide trade). Lietaer states that this would provide a currency that would not suffer from inflation: Terra = reference unit defined as standardized basket of key internationally traded commodities & services. Example: 100 Terra = 1 barrel of oil / + 10 bushels of wheat / + 20 kg of copper+ 1/10 of ounce of gold. NB: any standardizable good or service can be included. Similar stability to gold standard, but with basket instead of single commodity (more stable than any one component). Terra is Inflation-resistant by definition. The basic principle emerged from early concepts presented in an article in the French newspaper "Le Fédériste" on 1 January 1933. The idea to establish a "L'Europa – monnaie de la paix", in English "Europe - Money of peace", was given birth. The idea was enthusiastically picked up by Lietaer during an educational journey.
LINK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(currency)

"According to Lietaer in his influential The Future of Money, there is a four-tiered monetary system for the future. People and businesses will routinely deal in this multiple currency system, as we use all kinds of value cards, air miles, vouchers, credit and debit cards and virtual (cryptographic “crypto”) Complementary currencies CC.
 
The first tier of this monetary structure would be a ‘global reference currency’, which is not linked to nation states as such. This currency provides a steady reliable type of money that can be used for international trade based on internationally traded items like gold, copper, and wheat. Lietaer believes this kind of new world currency could morph into being from various corporate scrips used in cashless trade between businesses.

“Apparently, in the US, 400,000 businesses are linked to about 700 barter exchanges, which results in $8.5 billion in cashless trade. It seems that this kind of trade rips along at 15% a year, three times the speed of dollar commercial exchanges”.

A second tier in this monetary structure would be, for example, certain multinational currencies utilized by what would be deemed as geopolitically-close countries. This could include say the NAFTA dollar, the Euro, and an ASEAN (the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations) currency.

On the third level, we have some remaining national currencies which run within or outside the multinational currency regions. But this time, individual states no longer have the monopoly in issuance of currency.

At the fourth level, we have CCs/new money. To Lietaer, these CCs could have an expanded role and greater influence, as they may be widely used and exchanged through community internet clearing houses. 

The Terra is a CC that would be issued by a nation’s central bank. As outlined by Lietaer in his seminal “A ‘Green’ Convertible Currency”, what we will have is a “commodity-based currency, for a New Currency backed by a basket of from three to a dozen different commodities for which there are existing international commodity markets. For instance, 100 New Currency could be worth 0.05 ounces of gold, plus 3 ounces of silver, plus 15 pounds of copper, plus 1 barrel of oil, plus 5 pounds of wool.” This CC/new money is therefore backed by the valuation of the commodities in the basket at the value of the national currency of the society it originates from. So in the US, the value of the basket, in terms of USD, will determine the exchange rate between those trading in USD for the Terra in America. The Terra would work in tandem with the national currency and is not a new money that supplants everything else in its wake. As the Terra TRC (Trade Reference Currency) White Paper by Takashi Kiuchi, Chairman of The Future 500, states:

“The Terra is designed as a complementary currency operating in parallel with national currencies. Therefore, everything that exists today as monetary and financial products or practices continues to exist. The Terra mechanism is only one additional option available for those international economic actors who voluntarily choose to use it.”

STREAMING K ALGORITHM: streaming algorithms are algorithms for processing data streams in which the input is presented as a sequence of items and can be examined in only a few passes (typically just one). These algorithms have limited memory available to them (much less than the input size) and also limited processing time per item. These constraints may mean that an algorithm produces an approximate answer based on a summary or "sketch" of the data stream in memory. LINK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm

APPENDIX B: REFERENCES – ACRONYMS, METAPHORS, MEMES

Supreme Court precedent case Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank requires all internet, internet of money (Bitcoin, Blockchain) related patent applications to apply physical memes. For example, the internet TCP/IP “ping” terms is an abstraction. The internet’s “hop”, “hop count” is an abstraction. SAW Concept LLC’s application is compliant with the Supreme Court internet, internet of money precedent by using a Little League Baseball tournament as a main embodiment with internet technical theme derivative use cases

PAUL REVERE BASEBALL GAME BASE RUNNING LINEAR-SEQUENTIAL MEME

The Paul Revere linear-sequential meme – metaphor is a physical, historical meme used instead of an abstract metaphor that the internet uses called TCP/IP “hop counts”. 

Hop Counts: (123): Hops are linear and sequential referring to applicant's Paul Revere 
meme (126). Hops are described / defined from null as a condition / state: stationary, inactive. Hops are changes in location from point a to point b to point n. Hops follow a base running paradigm in the main embodiment (131) and are referential to TCP/IP in embodiment 1. Hops are counted incrementally where hops are changes in location e.g., home plate to first, second, and third base and back to home base (131).  Hop metrics are incremental changes from null 0,1,2,3,4 - N (126) that may be positive or negative values. Hop counts are used to equitably meter, measure and derive performance or effectiveness metrics, meters. Time stamps (112) form time frames, temporally bound hops e.g., in time and space.  Erlang logic is useful in establishing time boundaries and time limits among geo-spatially disperse events.

Time filtered and spatially metered reports are comprised of state meta-data snapshot / heartbeat message / sync delta messages where state meta data is harvested during micro-cycles then posted / displayed during longer macro-cycles. 
WATER DROP IN POND MEME 

“Water drop in pond meme directs to a detailed treatises describing geo-spatial temporal intensity metrics and meters using sonar in water as opposed to a TCP/IP internet ping. Reasons for this distinction is that sonar wave behavior in water used by naval military units is well known while a TCP/IP internet “ping” is an abstract metaphor formed by time intervals / cycles / epochs / CPU clock intervals that are used to process / not process instructions describing distances between internet nodes. 

Water Drop in Pond area, circular, circumference metaphor – meme: areas defined by radius / circumference (124) are described in terms of radii within a circumference of a circle used to encompass or encircle a cluster of players, teams, or leagues into a discrete set.  Resource items are typed, classified by <tags> measured from a known reference point i.e. ten-digit map grid coordinate describing a limited or bounded geo-spatial area described by concentric rings /circles shown to expand or contract with threshold metric changes denoting intensity i.e., an earthquake occurs during game with pre / aftershocks. Wave crests and troughs are converted into analog integer equivalents where amplitude and frequency changes convey event intensity, duration as thresholds. Discrete wave crest to trough phase changes are summed. Wave crests and troughs define cycles in terms of on, off, duration and describe slowing and speeding up of events, activities occurring within the circular geo-spatial area containing items of interest --see geo-spatial area entries, in related art for treatises 

Radius searches performed within circumference (124) use <tags> as search key tag / word targets. Search results are filtered and processed by tag classes and types then saved as search results time tagged with the micro-cycle heartbeat timestamp (112) running concurrently within and assisting with the formation of a self-organizing reporting cycle in a macro-cycle as part of a Heart Beacon Cycle (137). Radius searches are conducted to discover threshold, duration and intensity conditions changes useful in precedence processing parameters i.e., flash override, flash, immediate, priority routine shown on appliqué acetate overlay display boards (134).

PRECEDENT TRADE REFERENCE CURRENCY TRC / FRENCH MONEY OF PEACE: Later in the 1990's, Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer proposed a commodity based TRC Trade Reference Currency based on demurrage charges to support logistics of goods moved from supplier to consumer called the TERRA TRC. The Terra TRC Trade Reference Currency is a global complementary currency designed to provide an inflation-resistant international standard of value; to stabilize the business cycle on a global level; and to realign stockholder’s interests with long-term sustainability. From a legal viewpoint, the Terra is standardized “countertrade” (international barter), which is routinely used for over one trillion dollars worth of transactions per year. Legislation on countertrade exists in about two hundred countries, including all the major trading nations. SOURCE: https://lietaer.com/2010/01/terra/

Patent Application: Price Discover: 0160358256 [0056 In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, the amount of an investment required from a speculator is calculated by executing the following cost of speculation equation: V.intg.|log(P)-log(.DELTA.P)|/R dt. The variables for the cost of speculation equation are as follows: P represents a variable of price, P(t) is a variable function of price over time in a given market, .DELTA.P represent a speculative price function. P(t) can mathematically represent the future prices as functions of price over time. The function value of R(t) is a predetermined value for the rate of return. For example, for R(t), the value can be 100% annualized so for a t in years R(1)=2, R(2)=4 and R(0.5)=1.414, but as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, any function is possible. The value for V(t) at any given time is the expected value to the market (e.g., volume of goods to trade multiplied by the market commission) The value for V(t) can be updated empirically as the commodities market functions by calculation as a moving average of volume times the markets total transactional overhead charge.

The Paul Revere linear-sequential meme – metaphor is a physical, historical meme used instead of an abstract metaphor that the internet uses called TCP/IP “hop counts”. 

Hop Counts: (123): Hops are linear and sequential referring to applicant's Paul Revere 
meme (126). Hops are described / defined from null as a condition / state: stationary, inactive. Hops are changes in location from point a to point b to point n. Hops follow a base running paradigm in the main embodiment (131) and are referential to TCP/IP in embodiment 1. Hops are counted incrementally where hops are changes in location e.g., home plate to first, second, and third base and back to home base (131).  Hop metrics are incremental changes from null 0,1,2,3,4 - N (126) that may be positive or negative values. Hop counts are used to equitably meter, measure and derive performance or effectiveness metrics, meters. Time stamps (112) form time frames, temporally bound hops e.g., in time and space.  Erlang logic is useful in establishing time boundaries and time limits among geo-spatially disperse events. Time filtered and spatially metered reports are comprised of state meta-data snapshot / heartbeat message / sync delta messages where state meta data is harvested during micro-cycles then posted / displayed during longer macro-cycles,

QUANTUM COMPUTING: the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization. in a quantum Turing machine, the difference is that the tape exists in a quantum state, as does the read-write head. This means that the symbols on the tape can be either 0 or 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1; in other words, the symbols are both 0 and 1 (and all points in between) at the same time. While a normal Turing machine can only perform one calculation at a time, a quantum Turing machine can perform many calculations at once. The programmable economy will be anchored by quantum computing -for example, NIST's Quantum Random Number Beacon

The NIST Randomness Beacon Broadcasts a randomness pulse every 60 seconds Each pulse commits to a fresh 512-bit random string Each pulse is time-stamped and signed. Beacon periodically outputs a pulse containing 512 fresh random bits, time-stamped, signed and hash-chained. For example, each pulse also pre-commits to the randomness to be released in the next pulse. The latter enables users to securely combine randomness from different beacons. The Beacon protocol also specifies the interface for users to interact with the Beacon, in order to obtain information about past pulses. A randomness beacon produces timed outputs of fresh public randomness. Each output, called a pulse, includes metadata / cryptographic elements. The main goal of the NIST Random # Beacon is to serve as a baseline for deployment of many interoperable beacons NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/The-NIST-Randomness-Beacon-2-0/images-media/SciDay18-poster-beacon-v20181022.pdf

The BIG Bell Test: In 2015, NIST BOULDER | Colorado was one of the first groups to carry out a complete test of Bell theorem using quantum states of light, and conclusively show the presence of Einstein’s "spooky action." However, in that experiment the decisions about how to carry out the measurements were made by random numbers generated from different physical processes. https://thebigbelltest.org/team/nist-boulder/

Quantum Random Number Generator: The NIST method generates digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons, or particles of light, using data generated in an improved version of a landmark 2015 NIST physics experiment. That experiment showed conclusively that what Einstein derided as "spooky action at a distance" is real. Researchers process the spooky output to certify and quantify the randomness available in the data and generate a string of more random bits. LINK

NON-REPUDIATION: Cryptocurrency units of value events, transactions non-repudiation at any time – space, place in the future will be expected required and will be derived from a physical (photonic) light process generated by a Quantum Random Number Beacon QRNB. The QRNB provides a method and means to prevent repudiation of any event, transaction at any point in time – space.

Quantum computing based on waves at room temperature Vs particles in a liquid nitrogen cooled chamber given energy required to keep the environment near absolute zero with liquid nitrogen. Use of light waves at room temperature = more ecologically sustainable, more accurate quantum computing given less challenge to synchronize, stochastically harmonize quantum computing sites over UTZ Universal Time Zone as a basis for programming, computing programmable money / programmable economy.
"Schroedinger's equation at it's heart describes energy and looks similar to describing the action of waves in water" so, if an (observed) event can appear as a particle or a diffusion pattern in a wave, why not use diffusion patterns in waves at room temperatures Vs liquid cooled silicon computer chips chilled to near absolute zero for efficiencies in energy and accuracy at different temperature zones / elevations given temperature drops every 1000 meters / feet in altitude?

Quantum annealing starts from a quantum-mechanical superposition of all possible states (candidate states) with equal weights. Then the system evolves following the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, a natural quantum-mechanical evolution of physical systems. The amplitudes of all candidate states keep changing, realizing a quantum parallelism, according to the time-dependent strength of the transverse field, which causes quantum tunneling between states. If the rate of change of the transverse field is slow enough, the system stays close to the ground state of the instantaneous Hamiltonian (also see adiabatic quantum computation).[6] If the rate of change of the transverse field is accelerated, the system may leave the ground state temporarily but produce a higher likelihood of concluding in the ground state of the final problem Hamiltonian, i.e., diabatic quantum computation.[7][8] The transverse field is finally switched off, and the system is expected to have reached the ground state of the classical Ising model that corresponds to the solution to the original optimization problem. An experimental demonstration of the success of quantum annealing for random magnets was reported immediately after the initial theoretical proposal.[9]

IEEE Article: Quantum Computing Error Correct QEC is getting practical February 25th 2021: Quantum Error Correction QEC, in combination with the theory of fault-tolerant quantum computing, suggests that engineers can in principle build an arbitrarily large quantum computer that if operated correctly would be capable of arbitrarily long computations. This would be a stunningly powerful achievement. The prospect that it can be realized underpins the entire field of quantum computer science: Replace all quantum computing hardware with “logical” qubits running QEC, and even the most complex algorithms come into reach. For instance, Shor’s algorithm could be deployed to render Bitcoin insecure with just a few thousand error-corrected logical qubits.

Quantum Computing Quantum Circuit Quantum dots metrics

Science Alert: The latest invention follows the team's creation of the first ever quantum transistor in 2012. (A transistor is a small device that controls electronic signals and forms just one part of a computer circuit. An integrated circuit is more complex as it puts lots of transistors together.) To make this leap in quantum computing, the researchers used a scanning tunneling microscope in an ultra-high vacuum to place quantum dots with sub-nanometer precision. The placement of each quantum dot needed to be just right so the circuit could mimic how electrons hop along a string of single- and double-bonded carbons in a polyacetylene molecule.

Time crystals, first proposed by physicist Frank Wilczek in 2012, is a phase of matter which repeats in time, similar to how a regular crystal's structure repeats in space. What that means is that the particles in the crystal perpetually switch between two states without requiring the input of more energy and without losing any energy. These crystals are the first objects to break what is known as "time-translation symmetry," a rule in physics that states that a stable object will remain unchanged throughout time. Time crystals avoid this rule, being both stable and ever-changing. Scientists from Stanford and the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems, as well as scientists at QuTech, a collaboration between the Delft University of Technology and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), figured out for the first time how to create these theoretical crystals.
(Open) Telemetry OTEL

Observability has made it possible for both developers and operators to gain that visibility into their systems. In order to make a system observable, it must be instrumented. That is, the code must emit traces, metrics, and logs. The instrumented data must then be sent to an Observability back-end.

OpenTracing vendor-neutral API for sending telemetry data to an Observability back-end; it relied on developers to implement their own libraries to meet the specification.

OpenCensus provided a set of language-specific libraries that developers could use to instrument their code and send to any one of their supported back-ends.
single, vendor-agnostic instrumentation library per language with support for both automatic and manual instrumentation.
single vendor-neutral collector binary that can be deployed in a variety of ways.
end-to-end implementation to generate, emit, collect, process and export telemetry data.
control of data with the ability to send data to multiple destinations in parallel through (workflow rules) configuration.
Open-standard semantic conventions to ensure vendor-agnostic data collection
The ability to support multiple context propagation formats in parallel to assist with migrating as standards evolve.
OpenTelemetry main components:/ Cross-language specification
Tools to collect, transform, and export telemetry data/ Per-language SDKs
Automatic instrumentation and contrib packages
OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic proxy that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data. It supports receiving telemetry data in multiple formats (e.g., OTLP, Jaeger, Prometheus, as well as many commercial/proprietary tools) and sending data to one or more backends. It supports processing, filtering telemetry data before export. Collector contrib packages bring support for data formats and vendor backends.
Signals: In OpenTelemetry, a Signal refers to the categories of telemetry that are supported by the specification. It supports the Signals below:
Traces: Traces are the big picture of what happens when a request (s) is / are made 
Metrics: A metric is a measurement about a service, captured at runtime.
Logs: A log is a timestamped text record, either structured (recommended) or unstructured, with metadata.
Baggage: Baggage refers to contextual information that’s passed between spans
OpenTelemetry main components: Cross-language specification
Tools to collect, transform, and export telemetry data/ Per-language SDKs
Automatic instrumentation and contrib packages
OpenTelemetry lets you replace the need for vendor-specific SDKs and tools for generating and exporting telemetry data. Data: Defines the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) and vendor-agnostic semantic conventions 
Collector: The OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic proxy that can receive, process, and export telemetry data. It supports receiving telemetry data in multiple formats (e.g., OTLP, Jaeger, Prometheus, as well as many commercial/proprietary tools) and sending data to one or more backends. It also supports processing and filtering telemetry data before it gets exported. Collector contrib packages bring support for more data formats and vendor backends. For more information, see Data Collection.
Language SDKs: OpenTelemetry also has language SDKs that let you use the OpenTelemetry API to generate telemetry data with your language of choice and export that data to a preferred backend. These SDKs also let you incorporate automatic instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks that you can use to connect to manual instrumentation in your application. Vendors often make distributions of language SDKs to make exporting to their backends simpler. 
Automatic Instrumentation: OpenTelemetry supports a broad number of components that generate relevant telemetry data from popular libraries and frameworks for supported languages. For example, inbound and outbound HTTP requests from an HTTP library will generate data about those requests. Using automatic instrumentation may differ from language to language, where one might prefer or require the use of a component that you load alongside your application, and another might prefer that you pull in a package explicitly in your codebase.It is a long-term goal that popular libraries are authored to be observable out of the box, such that pulling in a separate component is not required.

The 13 Moon calendar is a solar-galactic cycle that meshes the 365-day third-dimensional solar cycle with the 260-day fourth-dimensional galactic cycle (Tzolkin) every 52 years. The 365-day orbit of Earth around the Sun naturally divides into thirteen 28-day sequences (13×28=364) which correspond to the thirteen lunations occurring during one solar year, plus one extra day, July 25, the Day Out of Time, a day to practice time is art and peace through culture. Its daily use helps entrain the mind into the threshold of galactic consciousness. The 13 Moon/28-day calendar embraces and synchronizes all true calendrical and mathematical systems, from lunar calendars, to the Mayan long count, to the Elder Futhark runes, to the I Ching hexagrams. In other words, this system reveals a master matrix, which contains all other systems. In the Gregorian calendar there is little cyclic or periodic order. Months are uneven; the length of months does not correlate with number of seven-day weeks, and the numbers change every month. https://lawoftime.org/education/
