Eco Economic Epochs: Eco sustainable  incentives for the programmable Economy - It's about TIME

THESIS: All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:
1.	Time epochs created by oscillating quartz crystal based silicon chips
2.	Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles

Time epochs / syntax: two main building blocks in creating the Artificial Intelligence A.I. powered global economic system of systems / Earth Intelligence Network EIN / Web 3.0 and the programmable economy in terms of temporal consistency, interoperability, and consensus.

PROJECT: Code Eco sustainable incentives into the world’s programmable economic system of systems engineering framework reusing / leveraging NATO systems of systems engineering best practice. Reuse OPSCODE brevity codes mapped to message symbol sets essential to Artificial Intelligence / human interaction ( i.e., man — machine interface). The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an Adaptive Procedural Template: Use Case: Eco Economic Epoch Heartbeats for the programmable economy.

Use Case: Code Eco sustainable incentives into programmable economic system of systems engineering framework reusing / leveraging NATO systems of systems engineering best practice

1. Reuse OPSCODE brevity codes mapped to message symbol sets enabling Artificial Intelligence / human interaction ( i.e., man — machine interface).

2. Apply lessons learned (bandwidth discipline, interoperability, OPTEMPO sync cycles... intrinsic to NATO SOP swords to plowshares following German military proposal use cases circa 2003.

NATO has invested 30 years of mapping OPSCODE brevity codes to symbology / symbols / symbol sets contained in 300 plus message set / use cases as part of Battlefield digitization, Net Centric Warfare NET Enabled Operations NEO NETOPS. Blockchain, crypto currency developers are recreating, reinventing this decades old, tedious, time intensive, labor intensive, expensive structured data exchange… wheel.

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time  - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an adaptive procedural template / checklist of ideas, methods, processes, procedures, algorithms, tools… used to organize diverse peoples speaking many different languages through the universal language of symbols into Distributed Autonomous groups organized in time - space to achieve common goals.

PROJECT BEACON: Reuse NATO's system of systems syntax lexicon OPSCODE brevity code structured data exchange, heartbeat micro to macro cycle Universal Time Zone UTZ sync to support an EIN Earth Intelligence Network neural net emulation. We have a clear and present opportunity and responsibility to improve temporal, geo-spatial, syntactic - semantic consistency, interoperability among myriad programmable money memes among a federated, distributed system of systems.

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a distributed system of systems engineering signaling -telemetry temporal, geo-spatial, semantic - syntactic sync and consensus foundation framework. A an adaptive procedural template checklist of tools, algorithms, cryptographic modules, it supports DAAE Distributed Autonomous Automated Economy Eco - Economic Heartbeat

The Heart Beacon Cycle is an adaptive procedural template checklist of things, processes, tools, building blocks useful to form, maintain Eco-responsible trade federations. Each item in the procedural template checklist links to a detailed treatise

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a swords to plowshares DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization project using NATO’s Situational Awareness system of systems engineering framework, processes, procedures and internet building blocks to establish an Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat, neural network emulation for the EIN Earth Intelligence Network and heartbeat sync pulse for a Universal Time Zone UTZ supporting a one world currency. It’s syntax lexicon library of OPSCODE brevity codes used in programmable money, the programmable economy is descriptive of all things internet, internet of money down to the quantum computing, quantum blockchain level. We can synchronize ourselves, our cities, towns, cyber-communities in time — space for a common purpose: shared, common, ecologically sound, responsible econometrics. 

This course of action in challenging times  involves reuse of over 300 NATO cases supported by hundreds of message sets further described in spread sheet row - column format populated by thousands of brevity OPSCODES mapped to symbols essential to artificial intelligence man - machine interface. NATO bases are small cities that transact virtually every good, item, commodity with it's host nation. Why reinvent the syntax lexicon Rosetta Stone wheel? Think of this as a system of systems tool to accelerate an EIN Earth Intelligence Net – see Project #UNRIG for mor information

Eco sustainable incentives integral to an Economic system of systems SoS engineering framework used by NATO for decades. Digital Nations need an (Eco sustainable) Economic Heartbeat & a consistent syntax lexicon library. Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN 

Economic #RESET is a mathematical certainty. Do we RESET the global system of systems as is or will we re-engineer using NATO system of systems engineering standing on the shoulders of giants

 IF / WHEN: Climate Change causes a drop in crop commodity food production by 20–25 % while population continues to grow, THEN it follows that this condition will become a matter of national security. It’s TIME to implement an Ecologically Sustainable Economic Heartbeat ELSE face > greater chaos by not leveraging proven system of system structured data exchange methods. An ecologically sustainable economic heartbeat is needed. Why wait until crisis, DEFCON 2 stage?
 
IF climate change causes a drop in crop commodity by 20–25 % while population grows, THEN this condition will become a matter of national security. THEN this will require revisiting Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer’s TRC Trade Reference Currency ELSE face >socio economic chaos TERRA Trade Reference Currency by Economist Bernard Lietaer LINK http://lietaer.com/2010/01/terra/  

Ecologically sustainable economic transactions need to be incentivized among the world’s Ecological and Economic system of systems. The world’s systems need to be time-space synchronized, stochastically harmonized across the one world, global UTZ Universal Time Zone via heartbeat messages using universally shared, standards based OPSCODE brevity codes drawn from a universal structured data exchange syntax lexicon with over 300 use case templates e.g., NATO’s lexicon library

System of Systems Engineering Framework: Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN. It is time to build a new economic system of systems framework. 

All things internet, net of money blockchain cryptocurrencies are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. The term DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization was coined by the RAND Corporation circa 2000. 

Nobel Prize winning Economist Milton Friedman’s K% rule is an “economic heartbeat”. K-Percent Rule DEFINITION: The K-Percent Rule proposal by economist Milton Friedman was the central bank should increase the money supply by a constant percentage every year. The K-Percent Rule proposes to set the money supply growth / reduction at a rate equal to the growth of real GDP each year. K-Percent Rule — Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/k-percent-rule.asp

HEARTBEAT SCOP Administrative Interface as an Internet, net of Money configuration tool. SCOP is a tool that exemplifies how the internet really works. There are no levels, layers, packets, frames, bits, ether gas, hashgraphs, bytes motes, block chain blocks, pings, packets... There are only 1) epoch time intervals, 2) syntax used as if, then, else instructions. Time epoch time cycles used / not used to parse, process syntax as instructions are the only building blocks available to scale the blockchain. Blockchain scaling usually involves a discussion of “layers” when the reality is that parsing, processing syntax (OPSCODE brevity codes, shards, hashes) is passed from the genesis Epoch Time Cycle 1 to a temporal follow on epoch time cycle often involving geo-spatial, temporal separation.
The programmable economy will be anchored by quantum computing -for example, NIST's Quantum Random Number Beacon

Quantum Computing: Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization. in a quantum Turing machine, the difference is that the tape exists in a quantum state, as does the read-write head. This means that the symbols on the tape can be either 0 or 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1; in other words the symbols are both 0 and 1 (and all points in between) at the same time. While a normal Turing machine can only perform one calculation at a time, a quantum Turing machine can perform many calculations at once.

Quantum Random Number Generator: The NIST method generates digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons, or particles of light, using data generated in an improved version of a landmark 2015 NIST physics experiment. That experiment showed conclusively that what Einstein described as "spooky action at a distance" is real. Researchers process the spooky output to certify and quantify the randomness available in the data and generate a string of more random bits. 

The NIST Randomness Beacon Broadcasts a randomness pulse every 60 seconds Each pulse commits to a fresh 512-bit random string Each pulse is time-stamped and signed. Beacon periodically outputs a pulse containing 512 fresh random bits, time-stamped, signed and hash-chained. For example, each pulse also pre-commits to the randomness to be released in the next pulse. The latter enables users to securely combine randomness from different beacons. The Beacon protocol also specifies the interface for users to interact with the Beacon, in order to obtain information about past pulses. A randomness beacon produces timed outputs of fresh public randomness. Each output, called a pulse, includes metadata / cryptographic elements. The main goal of the NIST Random # Beacon is to serve as a baseline for deployment of many interoperable beacons NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/The-NIST-Randomness-Beacon-2-0/images-media/SciDay18-poster-beacon-v20181022.pdf




Time filtered and spatially metered reports are comprised of state meta-data snapshot / heartbeat message / sync delta messages where state meta data is harvested during micro-cycles then posted / displayed during longer macro-cycles 
See hop count treatise referential to internet / TCP/IP treatises

IEEE 802.11AG is used for hop by hop detection and control for epoch assignment and hop 
counts management and for hop by hop detection function to determine hop by hop count 
corresponding to machine readable and executable null / 0 and steps from null representing hop 
counts e.g., +1, +2, +3, +4 and / or -1, -2, -3, -4 Paul Revere linear, sequential metaphor 
indicating distance traveled in context with router / server / switch / node traversal

metrics of increases / decreases in thresholds and by intensity, duration and hop count sums

Use Case: form federations of Distributed, Autonomous Organizations DAO communities, states, sovereign nations using an adaptive procedural template checklist promoting synchronization among geo-spatially and temporally dispersed groups using a common syntax – symbol set lexicon. Federated groups activities are synchronized geo-spatially across time - space to achieve synergy, synchronicity of events orchestrated from micro to macro cycles from grassroots to capitals

Heart Beacon Cycle Time – Space Meter: One method fits many not one size fits all

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space Meter and it's use cases are intended to bridge humanity from our present condition to a higher consciousness described by Extra Terrestrial Groups and organizations like the Law of Time dot org with their Noosphere concept

"One people, one Earth, one Time": "The times we are living in require higher thinking. There has never in the history of the Earth been a time like this. We are now participating in what is called the biosphere-noosphere transition: When life on Earth (the biosphere) evolves into an awakened planetary mind (noosphere)".

"Only by lifting our minds to planetary consciousness and beyond can we realize solutions to the multiple challenges facing our planet today. With a new consciousness we can effectively educate and mobilize humanity to an unprecedented level of creative problem solving, and realize a positive future." Source: http://lawoftime.org
