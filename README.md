TITLE: Distributed digital signaling, telemetry framework dashboard: Earth Intelligence Network EIN / GDP GNI GNP + index economy

DESCRIPTION: Systems of Federated Systems signaling, telemetry support framework for net, net of programmable money, econometrics for DAO Distributed Autonomous Organizations / trade federations participating in a new model eco sustainable programmable economy

SUMMARY: Adaptive Procedural Template forming / supporting a system of federated systems with a distributed signaling, telemetry (OPORD Annex K) framework derived from DARPA / Pentagon / NATO's Common Operational Picture COP-SIOP Single Integrated Operational Picture / system of systems engineering family of systems dating from the mid 1990's (swords to plowshares) / German Army suggestion to use COP - SIOP (Common Operational Picture, Single Integrated Operational Picture) Battlefield Digitization Digital Dashboard procedures for OOTW Operations Other Than War circa 2003

USPTO 13/573,002: The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space Meter Adaptive Procedural Template (checklist of useful tools, procedures, products, algorithms, econometrics, processes, metrics, meters, e.g., time - space, geo-spatial, temporal, cryptocurrency data storage into a "blockchain cube" with highth, width, depth, volume..) = universal programmable money metrics, meters for all metaphors, memes

USE CASE: checklist of items that a distributed global Trade Federation (s) need to for a global digital economic framework digital dashboard: GDP Gross Domestic Product Economy  EIN Earth Intelligence Network /  Eco Economic Epoch Heartbeats for a programmable economy World Economic Forum WEF GDP - GNP enhancements

THESIS: All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:
1.	Time epochs created by oscillating quartz crystal based silicon chips
2.	Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles

GIVEN / FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH: All things internet, net of money blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast protocols. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography.  Blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast,anycast and workflow filters. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Internet 3.0 and the new web will be based on the original structure described by Stanford University.  There are no packets, frames, blocks, Satoshi's traversing the net, stored in a blockchain cube.

INTERNET BUILDING BLOCKS: Time epochs / syntax are the two main internet, internet of money building blocks in coding the Artificial Intelligence A.I. powered economic system of systems / Earth Intelligence Network EIN / Web 3.0 and the programmable economy in terms of temporal consistency, interoperability, and consensus.

TRUTH: There are no “layers”, “bots”, “motes”, “packets”, “frames”, “Satoshi’s” traversing the internet, net of #money forming “blocks” on a “blockchain” that stores “tokens” in a cube structure with height, width, volume. All are non - compliant US Supreme Court SCOTUS Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank 2014 ruling “claims may not direct towards abstract ideas”

DIGITAL GOLD / SILVER: Programmable #money / #economy… gold, #Bitcoin as “digital gold” — fool’s #gold? How will programmable money for the programmable economy be coded?

UTZ Universal Time Zone: A one world #currency needs a stochastically harmonized, synchronized Universal Time Zone UTZ / event bus

NON-REPUDIATION: Cryptocurrency units of value events, transactions non-repudiation at any time – space, place in the future will be expected required and will be derived from a physical (photonic) light process. Physical is the opposite of abstract in light of SCOTUS Alice 2014 ruling #cryptocurrencies

FRAMEWORK: What is your solution framework based on EXISTING systems, code, best practice? Adaptive Procedural Template (checklist): Use case: GDP Index based Economy: Eco Economic Epochs Time-Space Meter Eco incentives, consensus, interoperability for the programmable economy, Earth Intelligence Network EIN / System of systems engineering framework from NATO Battlefield Digitization based on a German military idea to reuse Battlefield Digitization for OOTW Operations Other Than War circa 2003

VISION STATEMENT: We have a clear and present opportunity to improve temporal, geo-spatial, syntactic - semantic consistency, interoperability among myriad programmable money memes among a federated, distributed system of systems supporting a distributed, equitable, Eco-sustainable, and programmable global Economic framework. 

1) We can synchronize ourselves in time-space for common goals e.g., code an equitable, distributed programmable economy among trade federations (attributed to Law of Time . Org)

2) Eco_Econ_Epochs: It's about TIME: Eco incentives coded into the global programmable economic system of systems engineering framework based on NATO best practice into OPSCODEs mapped to symbol sets essential to Artificial Intelligence / man - machine interface - human interaction

ADAPTIVE PROCEDURAL TEMPLATE CHECKLIST: The Heart Beacon Cycle Time  - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an adaptive procedural template / checklist of ideas, methods, processes, procedures, algorithms, tools… used to organize a system of federated systems comprised of diverse groups, people speaking many different languages through the universal language of symbols into Distributed Autonomous groups organized in time - space to achieve common goals such as establishing an Ecologically sustainable Economic heartbeat. This idea involves reuse of over 300 use cases supported by hundreds of message sets further described in spread sheet row - column format populated by thousands of brevity OPSCODES mapped to symbols essential to artificial intelligence man - machine interface. NATO bases are small cities that transact virtually every good, item, commodity with it's host nation. Why reinvent the syntax lexicon Rosetta Stone wheel? Think of this as a system of systems tool to accelerate an EIN Earth Intelligence Net - an A.I. driven system of distributed systems digital dashboard among trade federation (s)

Use Cases: Eco #Economic Epochs Time-Space Meter #ecology Eco incentives, consensus, interoperability, sync, stochastic UTZ harmonization for programmable money, economy 

Use Case: Ecologically sustainable economic incentives coded into the programmable economy based on a tokenized economy - It's about Time - Space, syntax symbol set lexicon library supporting the Earth Intelligence Network / Noosphere. Main use case: GDP Gross Domestic Product Index based Economy / National - Global currency

FIAT based economies, currencies, units of value have always needed a RESET which is what the World Economic Forum, POTUS (in his commentary on the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay shooting with GIZA featured) et al have stated will occur starting in 2021. The plan is for the currency to be pegged to caches of gold, treasure to suddenly appear which will invoke the "golden rule". Several other luminaries like Edison (Edison's monetary option), Economist Milton Friedman, Bernard Lietaer (TRC Trade Reference Currency) have describe index funds to base a nation's / world currency - economy: “In the beginning (of time), there was the word” (syntax) = form for all things internet, net of $$$ 

Given: "Great #Economic RESET" of 2021 looming, consider a tangible, commodity backed currency unit of value, trade where closer = cheaper given less fuel is consumed:  GDP Index Economy powered by #Ericsson #Erlang time algorithms / time equations / NIST QRNB Quantum Random Number Beacon

Q: What's your vote for a one world currency for a one world government: 1. IMF's SDR basket 2. NESERA's QFS Las Vegas
3. Department of Commerce - Treasury - NIST QRNB at Boulder Colorado (Stephen King's The Stand's Free Zone) ? ﻿#IMF﻿ ﻿#NESERA﻿ ﻿#NIST﻿ 

Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman's K% rule is a GDP Gross Domestic Product economic heartbeat, a GDP pulse. Add a crypto coin index to commodity index and QRNB for non repudiation at any location / time in the future = basis for a one world economic system of systems unit of value WorldCoin https://twitter.com/i/status/1315621638579388418

GDP INDEX ECONOMY: Thomas Edison and Henry Ford proposed a currency based on a basket of crop commodities because Edison felt that crops held their value over time - enter climate change reality and the merits of this view are self evident. Later in the 1990's, Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer proposed a commodity based TRC Trade Reference Currency based on demurrage charges to support logistics of goods moved from supplier to consumer called the TERRA TRC. Prior to his passing, Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman described an "economic heartbeat" in his K% rule where the Treasury increases the money supply increases and decreases pegged to the GDP index. Nations / the world's economy would be managed as a composite value index similar to for example, Vanguard's index funds, commodity index funds. A snapshot or sync delta value taken at a predetermined time interval (micro-cycle to macro cycle) to determine the statistical mean value of the goods, commodities that comprise a GDP index is performed and used as the value of the organization's / nation's / world's unit of value as the basis for currency exchange. This process reuses DARPA / NATO's Battlefield Digitization, Net Enabled Operations NEO procedures that have supported the Pentagon's / NATO's digital dashboards since the 1990's. 

PROJECT BEACON: Reuse NATO's system of systems syntax lexicon OPSCODE brevity code structured data exchange, heartbeat micro to macro cycle Universal Time Zone UTZ sync to support an EIN Earth Intelligence Network neural net emulation. We have a clear and present opportunity and responsibility to improve temporal, geo-spatial, syntactic - semantic consistency, interoperability among myriad programmable money memes among a federated, distributed system of systems. Beacon Communities supported by an open source Earth Intelligence Network EIN powered by a quantum random number beacon blockchain - it's about time (space, syntax lexicon, econometrics..)

PROJECT BEACON: Code Eco sustainable incentives into the world’s programmable economic system of systems engineering framework reusing / leveraging NATO systems of systems engineering best practice. Reuse OPSCODE brevity codes mapped to message symbol sets essential to Artificial Intelligence / human interaction ( i.e., man — machine interface). The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an Adaptive Procedural Template: Use Case: Eco Economic Epoch Heartbeats for the programmable economy.

USE CASE: Code Eco sustainable incentives into programmable economic framework reusing / leveraging NATO systems of systems engineering best practice. Form federations of Distributed, Autonomous Organizations DAO communities, states, sovereign nations using an adaptive procedural template checklist promoting synchronization among geo-spatially and temporally dispersed groups using a common syntax – symbol set lexicon. Federated groups activities are synchronized geo-spatially across time - space to achieve synergy, synchronicity of events orchestrated from micro to macro cycles from grassroots to capitals.

1.	Reuse OPSCODE brevity codes mapped to message symbol sets enabling Artificial Intelligence / human interaction ( i.e., man — machine interface).

2.	Apply lessons learned (bandwidth discipline, interoperability, OPTEMPO sync cycles... intrinsic to NATO SOP swords to plowshares following German military proposal use cases circa 2003.

SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING: NATO has invested 30 years of mapping OPSCODE brevity codes to symbology / symbols / symbol sets contained in 300 plus message set / use cases as part of Battlefield digitization, Net Centric Warfare NET Enabled Operations NEO NETOPS. Blockchain, crypto currency developers are recreating, reinventing this decades old, tedious, time intensive, labor intensive, expensive structured data exchange… wheel. It may be stated that this project is a swords to plowshares initiative

PATENT APPLICATION USPTO 13/573,002 The Heart Beacon Cycle Time  - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an adaptive procedural template / checklist of ideas, methods, processes, procedures, algorithms, tools… used to organize diverse peoples speaking many different languages through the universal language of symbols into Distributed Autonomous groups organized in time - space to achieve common goals among individuals organized into federeated groups in DAO (s) Distributed Autonomous Organizations - a RAND Corporation term (DoD funded Think Tank) circa 2001. Each item in the procedural template checklist links to detailed treatise (s)

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a signaling, telemetry distributed systems engineering framework improving temporal, geo-spatial, semantic - syntactic sync & consensus among DAAE Distributed Autonomous Automated Economy system of systems reusing Battlefield Digitization, Net Enabled Operations engineering swords to plowshares . Eco sustainable incentives integral to an Economic system of systems SoS engineering framework used by NATO for decades. Digital Nations need an (Eco sustainable) Economic Heartbeat & a consistent syntax lexicon library. Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone using the firefly-heartbeat algorithm

SWORDS TO PLOWSHARES: The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a swords to plowshares DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization project using NATO’s Situational Awareness system of systems engineering framework, processes, procedures and internet building blocks to establish an Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat, neural network emulation for the EIN Earth Intelligence Network and heartbeat sync pulse for a Universal Time Zone UTZ supporting a one world currency. It’s syntax lexicon library of OPSCODE brevity codes used in programmable money, the programmable economy is descriptive of all things internet, internet of money down to the quantum computing, quantum blockchain level. We can synchronize ourselves, our cities, towns, cyber-communities in time — space for a common purpose: shared, common, ecologically sound, responsible econometrics.

COA Course of Action: reuse of over 300 NATO cases supported by hundreds of message sets described in spread sheet row - column format populated by thousands of brevity OPSCODES mapped to symbols essential to artificial intelligence man - machine interface. NATO bases are small cities that transact most goods, commodities with it's host nation. Why reinvent the syntax lexicon Rosetta Stone wheel? This is a system of systems tool to accelerate an EIN Earth Intelligence Net – see Project #UNRIG for mor information

DECISION POINT: Economic #RESET is a mathematical certainty. Do we RESET the global system of systems as is or will we re-engineer using NATO system of systems engineering standing on the shoulders of giants

1) CLIMATE CHANGE: IF / WHEN: Climate Change causes a drop in crop commodity food production by 20–25 % while population continues to grow, THEN it follows that this condition will become a matter of national security. It’s TIME to implement an Ecologically Sustainable Economic Heartbeat ELSE face > greater chaos by not leveraging proven system of system structured data exchange methods. An ecologically sustainable economic heartbeat is needed. Why wait until crisis, DEFCON 2 stage?

2) CLIMATE CHANGE: IF climate change causes a drop in crop commodity by 20–25 % while population grows, THEN this condition will become a matter of national security. THEN this will require revisiting Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer’s TRC Trade Reference Currency ELSE face >socio economic chaos TERRA Trade Reference Currency by Economist Bernard Lietaer LINK http://lietaer.com/2010/01/terra/

ECO INCENTIVES: Ecologically sustainable economic transactions need to be incentivized among the world’s Ecological and Economic system of systems. The world’s systems need to be time-space synchronized, stochastically harmonized across the one world, global UTZ Universal Time Zone via heartbeat messages using universally shared, standards based OPSCODE brevity codes drawn from a universal structured data exchange syntax lexicon with over 300 use case templates e.g., NATO’s lexicon library

SPACE THE FINAL FRONTIER:  Reuse of DARPA - NATO's structured data exchange that maps data element OPSCODES to symbol sets is key to Artificial Intelligence #AI man - machine interface, consensus, consistency among myriad #blockchain programmable #money memes, metaphors... Given space travel risks, navigation based on consciousness / telepathy (use of symbols not words), a consistent syntax lexicon to communicate with #UFO EBO's that are likely Artificial Intelligence AI drones is reuse of DARPA - NATO's structured data exchange that maps data element OPSCODES to symbol sets. Trade with E.T. / EBO’s (will) requires a consistent supply chain lexicon

NOBLE PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST: Milton Friedman’s K% rule is an “economic heartbeat”. K-Percent Rule DEFINITION: The K-Percent Rule proposal by economist Milton Friedman was the central bank should increase the money supply by a constant percentage every year. The K-Percent Rule proposes to set the money supply growth / reduction at a rate equal to the growth of real GDP each year. K-Percent Rule — Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/k-percent-rule.asp

NOBEL PRIZE WINNER Simon Smith Kuznets gross national income (GNI), previously known as gross national product (GNP), is the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country, consisting of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), plus factor incomes earned by foreign residents, minus income earned in the domestic economy by nonresidents (Todaro & Smith, 2011: 44).[2] Comparing GNI to GDP shows the degree to which a nation's GDP represents domestic or international activity. GNI has gradually replaced GNP in international statistics. Kuznets became the first economist to show that the Absolute Income Hypothesis gives inaccurate predictions in the long run (by using time-series data).

WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM WEF ENHANCED GDP: the World Econoic Forum has proposed a scorecard made up of four dimensions that need to be brought into balance: prosperity, the planet, people and the role of institutions. Prosperity vs economic growth. The Forum’s ‘Prosperity’ metric includes aspects such as social mobility, income or wealth inequality and financial resilience. GDP still features within the Prosperity dimension, but updated to reflect different dynamics within the world economy.

SCOP is a tool that exemplifies how the internet really works. SCOP is a web application, PHP based, that is a front-end to heartbeat. . SCOP  can start/stop services, view/edit configuration files, make backups, take a server online/offline, add/remove virtual/real servers, etc. 

WEB 3.0 MEMES / METAPHORES: There are no levels, layers, packets, frames, bits, ether gas, hashgraphs, bytes motes, block chain blocks, pings, packets... There are only 1) epoch time intervals, 2) syntax used as if, then, else instructions. Time epoch time cycles used / not used to parse, process syntax as instructions are the only building blocks available to scale the blockchain. Blockchain scaling usually involves a discussion of “layers” when the reality is that parsing, processing syntax (OPSCODE brevity codes, shards, hashes) is passed from the genesis Epoch Time Cycle 1 to a temporal follow on epoch time cycle often involving geo-spatial, temporal separation. See Alice ruling.

QUANTUM COMPUTING: the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization. in a quantum Turing machine, the difference is that the tape exists in a quantum state, as does the read-write head. This means that the symbols on the tape can be either 0 or 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1; in other words the symbols are both 0 and 1 (and all points in between) at the same time. While a normal Turing machine can only perform one calculation at a time, a quantum Turing machine can perform many calculations at once. The programmable economy will be anchored by quantum computing -for example, NIST's Quantum Random Number Beacon

1)	Quantum Random Number Generator: The NIST method generates digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons, or particles of light, using data generated in an improved version of a landmark 2015 NIST physics experiment. That experiment showed conclusively that what Einstein described as "spooky action at a distance" is real. Researchers process the spooky output to certify and quantify the randomness available in the data and generate a string of more random bits.

2)	The NIST Randomness Beacon Broadcasts a randomness pulse every 60 seconds Each pulse commits to a fresh 512-bit random string Each pulse is time-stamped and signed. Beacon periodically outputs a pulse containing 512 fresh random bits, time-stamped, signed and hash-chained. For example, each pulse also pre-commits to the randomness to be released in the next pulse. The latter enables users to securely combine randomness from different beacons. The Beacon protocol also specifies the interface for users to interact with the Beacon, in order to obtain information about past pulses. A randomness beacon produces timed outputs of fresh public randomness. Each output, called a pulse, includes metadata / cryptographic elements. The main goal of the NIST Random # Beacon is to serve as a baseline for deployment of many interoperable beacons NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/The-NIST-Randomness-Beacon-2-0/images-media/SciDay18-poster-beacon-v20181022.pdf

IEEE Article: Quantum Computing Error Correct QEC is getting practical February 25th 2021

Quantum Error Correction QEC, in combination with the theory of fault-tolerant quantum computing, suggests that engineers can in principle build an arbitrarily large quantum computer that if operated correctly would be capable of arbitrarily long computations. This would be a stunningly powerful achievement. The prospect that it can be realized underpins the entire field of quantum computer science: Replace all quantum computing hardware with “logical” qubits running QEC, and even the most complex algorithms come into reach. For instance, Shor’s algorithm could be deployed to render Bitcoin insecure with just a few thousand error-corrected logical qubits.

United States Patent Application: 0160358256[0056] In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, the amount of an investment required from a speculator is calculated by executing the following cost of speculation equation: V.intg.|log(P)-log(.DELTA.P)|/R dt. The variables for the cost of speculation equation are as follows: P represents a variable of price, P(t) is a variable function of price over time in a given market, .DELTA.P represent a speculative price function. P(t) can mathematically represent the future prices as functions of price over time. The function value of R(t) is a predetermined value for the rate of return. For example, for R(t), the value can be 100% annualized so for a t in years R(1)=2, R(2)=4 and R(0.5)=1.414, but as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, any function is possible. The value for V(t) at any given time is the expected value to the market (e.g., volume of goods to trade multiplied by the market commission) The value for V(t) can be updated empirically as the commodities market functions by calculation as a moving average of volume times the markets total transactional overhead charge.

The 13 Moon calendar is a solar-galactic cycle that meshes the 365-day third-dimensional solar cycle with the 260-day fourth-dimensional galactic cycle (Tzolkin) every 52 years. 

The 365-day orbit of Earth around the Sun naturally divides into thirteen 28-day sequences (13×28=364) which correspond to the thirteen lunations occurring during one solar year, plus one extra day, July 25, the Day Out of Time, a day to practice time is art and peace through culture. Its daily use helps entrain the mind into the threshold of galactic consciousness. 

The 13 Moon/28-day calendar embraces and synchronizes all true calendrical and mathematical systems, from lunar calendars, to the Mayan long count, to the Elder Futhark runes, to the I Ching hexagrams. In other words this system reveals a master matrix, which contains all other systems. 

In the Gregorian calendar there is little cyclic or periodic order. Months are uneven; the length of months does not correlate with number of seven-day weeks, and the numbers change every month. https://lawoftime.org/education/
