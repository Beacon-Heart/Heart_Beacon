Digital Nations need an (Eco sustainable) Economic Heartbeat üòç

Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat = system of systems engineering  signaling, telemetry  support framework for the DAE Distributed Autonomous Economy / The Automated Economy Source link: http://sawconcepts.com/index 

Economic #RESET is a mathematical certainty. Do we RESET the global system of systems as is or will we re-engineer using NATO / DARPA / DOD system of systems engineering framework standing on the shoulders of giants to convert swords to plowshares? 

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a swords to plowshares DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization project using NATO‚Äôs Situational Awareness system of systems engineering framework, processes, procedures and internet building blocks to establish an Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat, neural network emulation for the EIN Earth Intelligence Network and heartbeat sync pulse for a Universal Time Zone UTZ supporting a one world currency. It‚Äôs syntax lexicon library of OPSCODE brevity codes used in programmable money, the programmable economy is descriptive of all things internet, internet of money down to the quantum computing, quantum blockchain level. a.k.a Project BEACON / Medium Article LINK https://bit.ly/2s6Fnav

Eco Economic Heartbeat: It‚Äôs TIME: IF Climate Change causes a drop in crop commodity food production by 20‚Äì25 % while population continues to grow, THEN it follows that this condition will become a matter of national security. It‚Äôs TIME to implement an Ecologically Sustainable Economic Heartbeat ELSE face > greater chaos by not leveraging proven system of system structured data exchange tactics.

IF climate change causes a drop in crop commodity by 20‚Äì25 % while population grows, THEN this condition will become a matter of national security. THEN this will require revisiting Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer‚Äôs TRC Trade Reference Currency ELSE face > chaos LINK http://lietaer.com/2010/01/terra/

Ecologically sustainable economic transactions need to be incentivized among the world‚Äôs Ecological and Economic system of systems. The world‚Äôs system of systems needs to be time-space synchronized, stochastically harmonized across the world‚Äôs UTZ Universal Time Zone via synchronous heartbeat messages composed with OPSCODE brevity codes drawn from a universal structured data exchange syntax lexicon with over 300 use case templates.

To my knowledge, an Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat isn‚Äôt part of any #cryptocurrency #blockchain #trade #federation project nor part of #QAnon‚Äôs Plan, #Unrig #UnrigTheSystem EIN Earth Intelligence Network. Why is that? what should the E.E.HB be called, how should it be described? how should it be depicted in graphics? What is your definition of an Ecologically sustainable EconomicHeart Beacon?

System of Systems Framework: Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN. Is it time to build a new economic system of systems framework yet? Why wait for DEFCON Level 2 to start a system of systems sustainable project?

If, when climate change reduces crop commodity production while population continues to rise, it follows that this could become a National Security issue‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen, an ecologically sustainable economic heartbeat would be obviously needed. Why wait until crisis, DEFCON 2 stage?

All things #internet, net of #money #blockchain #cryptocurrencies rely on unicast, multicast‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike DoD / NATO‚Äôs #DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization system of systems‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa term coined by the RAND Corporation circa 2000. Programmable money‚Äôs improvements are in cryptography

Nobel Prize winning Economist Milton Friedman‚Äôs K% rule is what I call an ‚Äúeconomic heartbeat‚Äù K-Percent Rule. DEFINITION of ‚ÄòK-Percent Rule‚Äô. The K-Percent Rule was a proposal by economist Milton Friedman that the central bank should increase the money supply by a constant percentage every year. The K-Percent Rule proposes to set the money supply growth at a rate equal to the growth of real GDP each year.
