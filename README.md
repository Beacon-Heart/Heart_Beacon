Digital Nations need an (Eco sustainable) Economic Heartbeat 😍 Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat = system of systems engineering signaling, telemetry support framework for the DAAE Distributed Autonomous Automated Economy 
The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a distributed system of systems engineering signaling -telemetry temporal, geo-spatial, semantic - syntactic sync & consensus foundation framework supporting the DAAE Distributed Autonomous Automated Economy Eco - Economic Heartbeat. It is time to establish an ecologically sustainable economic heartbeat… PROJECT BEACON: Reuse NATO's system of systems syntax lexicon OPSCODE brevity code structured data exchange, heartbeat micro to macro cycle Universal Time Zone UTZ sync to support the EIN Earth Intelligence Network neural net emulation & improve temporal, geo-spatial, and syntactic - semantic consistency, interoperability among myriad programmable money memes.
The Heart Beacon Cycle is an adaptive procedural template checklist of things, processes, tools, building blocks useful to form, maintain Eco-responsible trade federations. Each item in the procedural template checklist links to a detailed treatise. We can synchronize ourselves, our cities, towns, cyber-communities in time — space for a common purpose: shared, common, ecologically sound, responsible econometrics. See the Law of Time organization’s site and the 441 Time Cube described by the late Dr. Jose Arguelles LAW OF TIME site http://lawoftime.org 
The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a swords to plowshares DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization project using NATO’s Situational Awareness system of systems engineering framework, processes, procedures and internet building blocks to establish an Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat, neural network emulation for the EIN Earth Intelligence Network and heartbeat sync pulse for a Universal Time Zone UTZ supporting a one world currency. It’s syntax lexicon library of OPSCODE brevity codes used in programmable money, the programmable economy is descriptive of all things internet, internet of money down to the quantum computing, quantum blockchain level. a.k.a Project BEACON / Medium Article LINK https://bit.ly/2s6Fnav 
Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN see Robert David Steele’s #UNRIG proposal @ http://robertdavidsteele.com
Economic #RESET is a mathematical certainty. Do we RESET the global system of systems as is or will we re-engineer using NATO system of systems engineering framework standing on the shoulders of giants to convert swords to plowshares?
Eco Economic Heartbeat: It’s TIME: IF Climate Change causes a drop in crop commodity food production by 20–25 % while population continues to grow, THEN it follows that this condition will become a matter of national security. It’s TIME to implement an Ecologically Sustainable Economic Heartbeat ELSE face > greater chaos by not leveraging proven system of system structured data exchange tactics.
IF climate change causes a drop in crop commodity by 20–25 % while population grows, THEN this condition will become a matter of national security. THEN this will require revisiting Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer’s TRC Trade Reference Currency ELSE face > chaos LINK http://lietaer.com/2010/01/terra/ If, when climate change reduces crop commodity production while population continues to rise, it follows that this could become a National Security issue — then, an ecologically sustainable economic heartbeat would be obviously needed. Why wait until crisis, DEFCON 2 stage?
Ecologically sustainable economic transactions need to be incentivized among the world’s Ecological and Economic system of systems. The world’s systems need to be time-space synchronized, stochastically harmonized across the UTZ Universal Time Zone via heartbeat messages composed with OPSCODE brevity codes drawn from a universal structured data exchange syntax lexicon with over 300 use case templates. 
System of Systems Framework: Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN. Is it time to build a new economic system of systems framework yet? Why wait for DEFCON Level 2 to start a system of systems sustainable project? All things #internet, net of #money #blockchain #cryptocurrencies rely on unicast, multicast — like DoD / NATO’s #DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization system of systems — a term coined by the RAND Corporation circa 2000. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography
Nobel Prize winning Economist Milton Friedman’s K% rule is what I call an “economic heartbeat” K-Percent Rule. DEFINITION of ‘K-Percent Rule’. The K-Percent Rule was a proposal by economist Milton Friedman that the central bank should increase the money supply by a constant percentage every year. The K-Percent Rule proposes to set the money supply growth at a rate equal to the growth of real GDP each year. K-Percent Rule — Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/k-percent-rule.asp
