Eco sustainable Economic HeartbeatHeart Beacon Cycle Time — Space Meter Main Use Case: establish an Eco sustainable Economic HeartbeatThe Heart Beacon Cycle Time — Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 application is an adaptive procedural template — checklist of ideas, methods, procedures, algorithms, swords to plowshare i.e., Battlefield Digitization Net Enabled Operations NEO best practice, tools… applied to organize people into groups synchronized into time-space for a common purpose: establish an Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat among widely distributed Eco centric trade federations

#Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN (see Robert David Steele's proposal @ http://robertdavidsteele.com)

We propose: Swords to plowshare re-use of tax subsidized research into optimal use of individuals joining groups synchronized in time-space to accomplish common goals e.g., consistent, equitable metrics and meters for geo-spatial, temporal econometrics, vectors for example, to reduce , CO2 carbon footprint due to inefficient transport, resource vectors through novel use of a time - space synchronization algorithm based on nature and NATO Battlefield Digitization, Network Enabled Operations NEO best practice to establish consistent metrics, meters for ecologic incentives i.e., closer = cheaper, less fuel among trade federations.

The Heart Beacon Cycle is an adaptive procedural template checklist of things, processes, tools, building blocks useful to form, maintain Eco-responsible trade federations. Each item in the procedural template checklist links to a detailed treatise. We can synchronize ourselves, our cities, towns, cyber-communities in time - space for a common purpose: ecologically sound, responsible econometrics.
