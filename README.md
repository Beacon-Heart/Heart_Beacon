Control Number:  13/573,002 Art Unit: 2468

VISION STATEMENT: Currency inflation / wars.. Economic reset - what's the plan ?

1, SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

USPTO 13/573,002 The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space Meter = Patent type: Adaptive Procedural Template Framework: checklist: ideas, algorithms, processes, procedures, metrics, meters, signal & telemetry structured data for consistent Eco sustainable economic time cycle epochs for programmable $ / economy / Net, Net of Money Foundation Technology for DeFi, programmable internet of money / Web 3.0

USPTO 13/573,002 framework supports for example, Distributed Trade Federation Organizations with DoD / NATO system of systems engineering signaling, telemetry engineering, syntax OPSCODE brevity codes matched with 2525C symbol sets vital for A.I. man-machine interface, interoperability, consistency, spatial – temporal consensus.

Question: what constitutes foundation tech for #DeFi / programmable $$$ ? Teams are forming to win the DeFi Distributed Finance / programmable $$$ - money IP Intellectual Property wars. The winning team will prove that their IP intellectual property filings establishes / established foundation technology. What is foundation technology given the SCOTUS 2014 "Alice in Wonderland" ruling? The internet and now the internet of money Web 3.0 is described with memes, metaphors, made up words. 

THESIS: All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:
1.	Time epochs created by oscillating quartz crystal silicon chips
2.	Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles

All things internet, internet of money, blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast protocols. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast and workflow filters. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Web 3.0 is based on the original internet TCP/IP structure that has not changed because it cannot change. 

Statement: there are no packets, frames, layers, blocks, shards, graphs, hash graphs “bots”, “motes”, … or Satoshi's traversing the net, stored in a blockchain cube. Transactions are unicast, multicast, or anycast (workflow). The afore mention terms are non-existent, fictitious, imaginary metaphorical fabrications that are non - compliant with US Supreme Court SCOTUS Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank 2014 ruling “claims may not direct towards abstract ideas”. Physical is the opposite of abstract.
 
Nobel Prize winning Economist Milton Friedman “only a crisis brings real change” 

Nobel Prize Winning Economist Milton Friedman: “Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.” ― Milton Friedman

PURPOSE: Provide signaling, telemetry, data element syntax lexicon support for economist Milton Friedman’s K% rule where a FEDCOIN / WORLDCOIN currency is supported from sampling lead economic indicators i.e., commodity RWA Real World Assets measurable, tangible, tokenized assets across a universal event bus applying the firefly-heartbeat algorithm tracking changes, updating q statistical mean value index. Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman described an "economic heartbeat" in his K% rule where the Treasury increases the money supply increases and decreases pegged to increases, decreases in GDP index volume.

PURPOSE: Climate change impact on food production: given food, fertilizer shortages (wheat, sunflower, soybean...), energy, fuel prices and looming fuel rationing, it logically follows that the world has no other options than to organize both micro (local) and macro (global) economies observing space - time conservative SLA Service Level Agreements where closer = cheaper given closer = less fuel, C02, time resources used to produce, ship.. Demurrage fees incentivize conservation of resources, commodities i.e., discounts for locally produced, consumed goods and commodities. It is TIME.
 
2. USE CASES

1. Supreme Court US SC 573 US 134 2347 Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank compliant physical meme i.e., cryptocurrency blockchain Digital Ledger Technology DLT programmable money meme

2. Foundation technology for programmable money / economy i.e., Syntax Lexicon Namespace derived from NATO / DoD  brevity OPSCODE FFIRN, FFUDNS structured data exchange mapped to symbols for A.I. Big Data. Establishes a consistent, universal syntax structured data exchange library – lexicon using UTZ time stamping data by organization <Org_ID>. data class type, resource type to form a universal syntax, code, date element </tag> Rosetta Stone given all things internet are formed using 1. time epoch cycles 2. syntax as instructions 

3. Distributed Autonomous Organization DAO Trade Federation common signaling, telemetry, symbol, and data element sets forming a foundation technology framework including structured data exchange to assist DAO’s stay synchronized, stochastically harmonized across UTZ zones.

4. Tether, untether to autonomous trade federations using agile, adhoc NetOps as an option to formal merger, acquisition. Support federations: from Latin: foedus, gen.: foederis, covenant characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central government.

5. Micro to macro-cycle system of systems data updates at agreed upon times observing agreed durations i.e., stock, commodity, currency trade epochs. Discrete time interval start, stop, TTL Time To Live trade windows commands embedded in </108> heartbeats, heartbeat messages.

6. Algorithmic regulation: firefly inspired heartbeat synchronization algorithm in stocks, currency exchanges is a segue to algorithmic regulation. Improving temporal trade parity between Bitcoin Blockchain & conventional stock exchanges by using the firefly-heartbeat algorithm to take trade speed samples among trade populations across time zones to establish consensus among disparate trade protocols, optimal trade speed / frequency as a statistical mean. 

7. The "Grail" A sync'd shared situational awareness view derived from filtering, prioritizing events drawn from a system of systems universal heartbeat message event bus sync delta epoch updates Universal Time Zone UTZ proposal using via improvement to the University of Bologna / Hungary’s firefly inspired heartbeat synchronization algorithm by matching the firefly synchronization pulse to the closest OPTEMPO Heart Beacon Cycle. 

7. Support economist Milton Friedman’s K% rule where a CBDC, federal, world currency is derived from sampling lead GDP economic indicators across a global event message bus sync delta changes updating a RWA Real World Asset based commodity index backed currency.

8. Ecologically sustainable economic econometric epoch time cycles to measure, meter sync delta cyclic changes describes linear sequential, geo-spatial temporal intensity radius hop count econometric metrics and meters where closer is shorter and closer is cheaper, less CO2 SLA

9. Data over wired, wireless power lines SLA service level agreement where closer = cheaper given closer involves maintenance of electrical, data equipment infrastructure
