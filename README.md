QUOTE: “Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.” Milton Friedman Nobel Prize winning Economist who described a GDP Gross Domestic Product commodity RWA Real World Asset based K% rule to monetize a currency, implement GDP based rules automated inflation control to manage the global economy.

System of systems is a collection of task-oriented or dedicated systems that pool their resources and capabilities together to create a new, more complex system which offers more functionality and performance than simply the sum of the constituent systems. Currently, systems of systems is a critical research discipline for which frames of reference, thought processes, quantitative analysis, tools, and design methods are incomplete.[1] The methodology for defining, abstracting, modeling, and analyzing system of systems problems is typically referred to as system of systems engineering.

Overview: Commonly proposed descriptions—not necessarily definitions—of systems of systems,[2] are outlined below in order of their appearance in the literature:
Linking systems into joint system of systems allows for the interoperability and synergism of Command, Control, Computers, Communications and Information (C4I) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Systems:[3] description in the field of information superiority in modern military.

System of systems are large-scale concurrent and distributed systems the components of which are complex systems themselves:[4] description in the field of communicating structures and information systems in private enterprise.

System of systems education involves the integration of systems into system of systems that ultimately contribute to evolution of the social infrastructure:[5] description in the field of education of engineers on the importance of systems and their integration.

System of systems integration is a method to pursue development, integration, interoperability and optimization of systems to enhance performance in future battlefield scenarios:[6] description in the field of information intensive systems integration

Modern systems that comprise system of systems problems are not monolithic, rather they have five common characteristics: operational independence of the individual systems, managerial independence of the systems, geographical distribution, emergent behavior and evolutionary development:[7] description in the field of evolutionary acquisition of complex adaptive systems in the military.

Enterprise systems of systems engineering is focused on coupling traditional systems engineering activities with enterprise activities of strategic planning and investment analysis:[8] description in the field of information intensive systems in private enterprise.

System of systems problems are a collection of trans-domain networks of heterogeneous systems that are likely to exhibit operational and managerial independence, geographical distribution, and emergent and evolutionary behaviors that would not be apparent if the systems and their interactions are modeled separately:[9] description in the field of National Transportation System, Integrated Military and Space Exploration. Taken together, all these descriptions suggest that a complete system of systems engineering framework is needed to improve decision support for system of systems problems. Specifically, an effective system of systems engineering framework is needed to help decision makers to determine whether related infrastructure, policy and/or technology considerations as an interrelated whole are good, bad or neutral over time.[10] The need to solve system of systems problems is urgent not only because of the growing complexity of today's challenges, but also because such problems require large monetary and resource investments with multi-generational consequences.

System-of-systems topics: The system-of-systems approach: While the individual systems constituting a system of systems can be very different and operate independently, their interactions typically expose and deliver important emergent properties. These emergent patterns have an evolving nature that stakeholders must recognize, analyze and understand. The system of systems approach does not advocate particular tools, methods or practices; instead, it promotes a new way of thinking for solving grand challenges where the interactions of technology, policy, and economics are the primary drivers. System of systems study is related to the general study of designing, complexity and systems engineering, but also brings to the fore the additional challenge of design. Systems of systems typically exhibit the behaviors of complex systems, but not all complex problems fall in the realm of systems of systems. Inherent to system of systems problems are several combinations of traits, not all of which are exhibited by every problem

Operational Independence of Elements, Managerial Independence of Elements, Evolutionary Development, Emergent Behavior, Geographical Distribution of Elements, Interdisciplinary Study, Heterogeneity of Systems, and Networks of Systems

The first five traits are known as Maier's criteria for identifying system of systems challenges. The remaining three traits have been proposed from the study of mathematical implications of modeling and analyzing system of systems challenges by Dr. Daniel DeLaurentis and his co-researchers at Purdue University.
Research: Current research into effective approaches to system of systems problems includes: Establishment of an effective frame of reference, Crafting of a unifying lexicon, Developing effective methodologies to visualize, communicate complex systems, Distributed resource management, Study of designing architecture, Interoperability, Data distribution policies: policy definition, design guidance and verification, Formal modelling language with integrated tools platform, Study of various modeling, simulation and analysis techniques:, network theory. agent based modeling, general systems theory, probabilistic robust design (including uncertainty modeling/management), object-oriented simulation and programming, multi-objective optimization. Study of various numerical and visual tools for capturing the interaction of system requirements, concepts and technologies. Sample Applications

Systems of systems, while still being investigated predominantly in the defense sector, is also seeing application in such fields as national air and auto transportation and space exploration. Other fields where it can be applied include health care, design of the Internet, software integration, and energy management and power systems. Social-ecological interpretations of resilience, where different levels of our world (e.g., the Earth system, the political system) are interpreted as interconnected or nested systems, take a systems-of-systems approach. An application in business can be found for supply chain resilience. Reference: Wikipedia

1.15 METHODS
Specific activities depend on the type of use case. However, all use cases are iterative and follow the design of adaptive procedural templates – see detailed treatise (s)

1.15.1 METHOD 1: A systemic, adaptive, procedural template method used to improve synchronization in metrics, metering using </Org_ID>, {“URN”} XML data tags in signaling during heartbeat micro-cycles prior to data fusion center entry consisting of iterative heartbeat cycle metrics, meters reporting where state meta data heartbeat snapshot recalculations are performed at offsite connectors that are signaling relays performing recalculation, syntax processing during macro-cycle epochs reconciling dissimilar standards, data syntax formats that are then reported signaled, news casted, beacon broadcasted to distributed organization applique overlay displays

1.15.2 METHOD 2. An adaptive procedural template used to improve signaling, synchronization, stochastic harmonization across UTZ Universal Time Zones using TCP/IP heartbeat time stamping occurring during micro-cycles of state meta data prior to data fusion center entry among metrics, metering processes comprised of TCP/IP heartbeats, heartbeat messages signaled during micro-cycles scheduling instructions, commands, processes, procedures, algorithms, telemetry instructions for example, to master-controller processes i.e., block, start, stop, pause, resume, set Time To live TTL i.e., stock market high frequency flash trade, currency, interest rates, tax rates, time banking, cloud computing commodity exchanges, big data, electrical micro-grid, fungible goods, real time bidding, many use cases. Time stamping and applying descriptive data type tags to heartbeat state meta data after data is collected and queued, stored in temporary structures or entered into database instantiations after the fact is problematic. All internet supported devices including high frequency stock, currency, commodity etc., flash trade master controllers receive heartbeats. System Heartbeats are intervals, epoch time cycles used to (not) process syntax.

1.15.3 METHOD 3 A systemic adaptive procedural template method improving stochastic networks harmonization through use of timing, synchronization intrinsic to TCP/IP heartbeat / heartbeat message signaling using set, scheduled, epochs in micro-cycles in combination with firefly insect signaling stochastic harmonization algorithms where firefly protocol sample means are matched with closest heartbeat sync delta micro-cycle report values to recalculate statistical averages, means signaled through off site connector conversion, recalculation gateways that news-cast, beacon broadcast to subscribers monitoring macro-cycle reports that heretofore would not exist without following the Heart Beacon Cycle procedural template as guides for reporting thus improving temporal harmonization in metrics and metering of stochastic telecommunication mesh fabrics grid control planes over wide areas in cases involving issues in terms of consistency, reliability, traceability, positive organizational identification, temporal transaction fidelity, event, alert predictability, data analytics, network forensics real rime bidding, stock market exchange floor server co-location verses servers distantly located, fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchanges, double payment adjudication, fungible good trading stochastic harmonization, electrical power micro-grids, cloud computing, spatial – temporal "big data"...

1.15.4 METHOD 4. A systemic adaptive procedural template method using time stamping and signaling intrinsic to TCP/IP heartbeat, heartbeat sync delta snapshots, heartbeat </108> message signaling to enable adaptive organization change management using XML <ORG_ID> network service interface NSI templates updating self-organizing process templates i.e., directory service, reporting, map, network, system of systems effecting changes in directory structures database MIB i.e., network subnet joins, moves, splits drops, adds as alternatives to mergers, acquisitions effecting changes responsive to leader’s actions, decisions i.e., mission-aware networking, network centric operations improving agile, ad hoc organizational business operations course of actions selection by organizations improving action / reaction to change. Use cases: network moves, adds, joins, splits, drops used instead of merger, acquisition.

1.15.5 METHOD 5. A systemic adaptive procedural template method improving search engine methods using heartbeat, beacon signaling, <ORG_ID>, , <class_types>, Paul Revere, water drop in pond meme metric recalculations occurring at offsite connectors, conversion relay gateways where detection of trigger point function recalculations of state meta data set aggregations are used to detect threshold fluctuations by resource, quantity, availability duration etc., further used to improve geo-spatial temporal descriptive mapping methods, changes in clusters of objects, entities, artifacts i.e., location, epoch time stamp geo-spatially, temporally, used to locate, search, then group into virtual collections using <data_tags> i.e., in spatial econometric, volumetric operations within network mesh fabrics triggering news-casting invitations to join equitably metered federated group arbitrage events, activities that are triggered by internet search operations improving collaboration, metrics and metering in for example, commodity, fungibles trading, resource pooling, crowd sourcing, economics.

1.15.6 Method 6: Physical linear – sequential “Paul Revere” meme used to represent TCP/IP internet “hops” that are abstractions ineligible for patent protection. Water drop in pond physical metaphor describes geospatial temporal intensity in omni-directional, circle, radius type situations. Naval sonar water drop in pond USPTO 13/573,002 meme explains geo-spatial temporal intensity metrics, meters using a physical metaphor. TCP/IP “ping” is an abstraction as are “packets”, “frames”, “hops”, “Satoshi’s” as data stores in a cryptocurrency “blockchain” (distributed database)

1.16.7 METHOD 7. A systemic adaptive procedural template method used to improve handicapped / information alerts, events, methods reliant on heartbeat timing, signaling synchronization of state meta-data improved using Paul Revere, water drop in pond memes to create, calculate radius, intensity metrics viewed as geo-spatial, temporal intensity effects i.e., visual light bar tabs i.e., stock exchange candlestick charts, audible tone, vibration-tactile situational awareness alerts by correlating tone based messaging precedence XML where lower / higher precedence settings equate to lower / higher audible tones, tactile vibrations for deaf where fewer / greater number of light tabs lit correlates, corresponds to priority, precedence further used in alert triggers of threshold fluctuations displayed in appliqué overlay graphics as metrics, meters. Reference: Describes reuse of structured military messaging’s precedence system to support for example, processing of Named Data Networking distance, interest packets by numeric precedence. This method is effective among machine to machine (Internet of Things).

1.15.8 METHOD 8. A systemic, adaptive procedural template method using heartbeat signaling, time stamp record keeping processes of state meta data described, typed by organizations, resources typed by Uniform Resource Name, further improved through use of Paul Revere, Water Drop in Pond memes to quantify, describe unused resources with unmet needs by performing recalculations of state meta-data snapshot artifacts occurring at offsite connector conversion gateways where micro-cycle reports from local, micro-cycle activities are signaled, relayed to higher echelon organizations monitoring macro-cycles who are interested in for example stock market "pools” where "output" is correlated and displayed onto appliqué views of aggregate sync delta changes in macro-micro economics recalculations, stocks, commodities, currencies, interest rates, electric micro-grids, currency (Terra) exchanges, spatial econometrics, contributory economics. Syntax code language parsed, processed during silicon chip generated time cycles forms all things internet, internet of money.

1.15.9 Method 9: Method / Claim describes the military’s network centric operations systems of systems method of collecting state meta data sync delta heartbeat snapshot data during operational micro-cycles that is then summed, aggregated, disseminated and displayed during macro-cycles as part of Network Enabled Operations NEO situation awareness system of systems engineering best practice over time

1.15.10 Invention relies on System of systems type processes: collection of task-oriented, dedicated systems pooling resources, capabilities together to create a more complex system with more functionality, performance than the sum of separate systems 

1.16 Outputs: State meta data collected from a current micro-cycle to the next and from many micro-cycles summed, aggregated to report during macro-cycle reporting periods are stored, collected in the off-site collector depicted by that corresponding workflow symbol.

A.I. Artificial Intelligence / Machine Algorithmic – Robotic Trade implications
Fortune Magazine: “If you’re a bank and don’t have an AI strategy, then you don’t have a strategy,” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said during a recent Bloomberg Television interview. “A.I. is here to stay.” SEC chair Gensler warning of AI’s “systemic risks” and a “nearly unavoidable” financial crisis within the next decade due to the “herding effect” of multiple firms relying too much on single AI models. In July, SEC regulatory agency proposed rules specifically over concerns that AI could prioritize a firm’s interests over its clients. the world moves quickly, leaving the SEC to figure out just how — and how much — AI is being used. In a process known as a “sweep,” the SEC has requested information from various firms seeking responses to prompts on 26 topics, such as how algorithmic models are used to manage client portfolios and what contingency plans exist for system failure, according to the WSJ, which obtained a copy of an SEC letter sent to a firm. A sweep doesn’t mean the SEC is investigating misconduct, but that it’s collecting information ahead of possible rule changes or new regulations. The problem is that the machine ha, already risen. “The use of these kinds of technologies is already so widespread that it would be quite difficult for the commission to put the brakes on,” Amy Jane Longo litigation enforcement practice partner Ropes & Gray / WSJ.

Computing an Optimal Pitching Strategy in a Baseball At-Bat
A novel model of a baseball at-bat as a zero-sum stochastic game, in which the goal of the batter is to get on base and the pitcher aims to prevent it. The paper proposes novel representations of pitcher and batter, a deep neural network architecture for outcome prediction, and experiments using Kaggle data from MLB seasons.

 Computing an Optimal Pitching Strategy in a Baseball At-Bat - arXiv.org

Every at-bat ends in one of two ways: 1) the batter is out (and, in our model, the pitcher wins), for example, after receiving the third strike, or 2) the batter gets on-base, for example, by hitting a home run. In modeling an at-bat, we assume that the goal of the batter is solely to get on base, while the pitcher aims to get the batter out.

Simulation of Baseball Gaming by Cooperation and Non-Cooperation Strategies
Matías Alvarado, Arturo Yee Rendón, and Germinal Cocho 1 Computer Sciences Department, Center for Research and Advance Studies, Mexico City, Mexico
2 Complex Sciences Department, Physics Institute, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico 

Baseball is a top strategic collective game that challenges the team manager’s decision-making. A classic Nash equilibrium applies for non-cooperative games, while a Kantian equilibrium applies for cooperative ones. We use both Nash equilibrium (NE) and Kantian equilibrium (KE), separate or in combination, for the team selection of strategies during a baseball match: as soon as the selection of strategies by NE or KE carries a team to stay match loosing, a change to KE or NE is introduced. From this variation of selection of strategies, the team that is losing tends to close or overcome the score with respect to the team with advantage according to the results from computer simulations. Hence, combining Nash selfish-gaming strategies with Kantian collaboration-gaming strategies, a baseball team performance is strengthened.
Keywords. Baseball strategies, cooperation and noncooperation, Nash equilibrium, Kantian equilibrium, computer simulations.

Black Sox Major League 1919 World Series Baseball game-fixing scandal: eight members of the Chicago White Sox were accused of losing the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds on purpose in exchange for money from a gambling syndicate led by Arnold Rothstein. The National Baseball Commission was dissolved, and Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was appointed to be the first Commissioner of Baseball and given absolute control over the sport to restore its integrity. Philadelphia Bulletin published a poem which would quickly prove to be ironic:

BLOCKCHAIN DISTRIBUTED LEDGER: provides a tamper-proof data structure, providing a shared public ledger open to all. The mathematics involved are impressive, and the use of specialized hardware to construct this vast chain of cryptographic data renders it practically impossible to replicate. All transactions are embedded in the bitcoin blockchain. Use of SHA-256 cryptography ensures the integrity of the blockchain applications – all transactions must be signed using a private key or seed, which prevents third parties from tampering with it. Transactions are confirmed by the network within 10 minutes or so and this process is handled by bitcoin miners. Mining is used to confirm transactions through a shared consensus system, and usually requires several independent confirmations for the transaction to go through. This process strives towards random distribution and makes tampering difficult.

BLOCH SPHERE: In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system ( qubit ), named after the physicist Felix Bloch. Quantum mechanics is mathematically formulated in Hilbert space or projective Hilbert space.

Blockchain Tri-lemma: The perfect blockchain includes three elements: Security, decentralization, and scalability. Finding a balance between the three is difficult and presents a problem referred to as the blockchain trilemma. Scalability and decentralization are often held back by security, but security tends to be compromised by any shifts on a network that offer scalability. Projects either choose to focus on two out of three or work on finding a solution to tackle the trilemma once and for all. Innovative ideas like sharding, side-chains and state channels are used to address the trilemma. A solution to the problem could lead to greater adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain and a wide-spread use of the technology across industries.

CASPER PoC3 Blockchain BACKBONE: Casper is a security-deposit based economic consensus protocol. Nodes, as “bonded validators”, have to place a security deposit (action called “bonding”) in order to serve the consensus by producing blocks. The protocol’s direct control of these security deposits is the primary way in which Casper affects the incentives of validators. Specifically, if a validator produces anything that Casper considers “invalid”, their deposit is forfeited along with the privilege of participating in the consensus process. The use of security deposits addresses the “nothing at stake” problem; that behaving badly is not expensive. When something is at stake, bonded validators who misbehave in an objectively verifiable manner will lose it.

CEILIOMETER, GNOCCHI, PANDA: builds metering around a data structure called samples. A sample is generated each time Ceilometer measures something. It is composed of a few fields, such as the resource id that is metered, the user and project ID owning resources, the meter name, the measured value, a timestamp and a few free-form metadata. Each time Ceilometer measures something, one of its components (an agent, a pollster…) constructs and emits a sample headed for the storage component called the collector. The collector is responsible for storing samples into a database. The Ceilometer collector uses a pluggable storage system usable with any database

To reduce the variance/noise, run many independent copies in parallel and combine their outputs. Count sketch is a probabilistic data structure designed to answer the following question: Reading a stream of elements a1, a2, a3, ..., where many elements are replicas in a given time it will provide an answer to question: how many original elements have been seen Count minimum sketch is a probabilistic data structures sacrificing certainty for space. Count minimum sketch selects 2 parameters: accuracy of the results ε and probability of bad estimate δ.

DASH: Unlike Bitcoin nodes, Master nodes receive payments for their service to the network – similar to demurrage charges in the Trade Reference Currency TERRA TRC. Dash includes decentralized funding, decentralized governance, decentralized storage. Dash's governance system, visit https://dash.org. Dash features: - InstantX:

Masternodes instantly lock transactions to solve the problem of lag time in transactions 

- Self-Budgeting: To solve the problem of lack of funding for development, Masternodes can direct funds right from the blockchain to support development.

- Self-Governance: To solve the problem of making governance decisions on the future of the currency, Masternodes can vote on what development occurs.

DEMURRAGE FEE: "the (carrying) costs for (holding) currencies/commodities," or "international maritime shipping delay penalty fees." The TRC is a demurrage-charged currency. A demurrage charge acts much like a parking or rental fee, incurring a cost over time to its holder. The cost for holding onto the TRC currency is estimated at 3.5%-4% per annum. This demurrage charge insures the currency’s use mainly as a trading device: it would not be hoarded but always tend to remain in circulation. It would thereby strongly activate commercial exchanges and investments wherever it circulates, the opposite of a conventional currency.

DEMMURAGE FEE / SATOSHI: The Satoshi represents one hundred millionths of a bitcoin because bitcoin has increased in value exponentially, smaller denominations are needed to facilitate smaller transactions. Small denominations make bitcoin transactions easier to conduct and, can act as demurrage fees to for example, move real world assets / commodities from point a to point n within trade federations.

ERICSSON OPEN MONEY: Ericsson Patents Open Money for Society 20130166398 “System And Method For Implementing A Context Based Payment System.”  "It is our vision that one day everyone with access to a mobile phone will be able to spend, send and receive money as easily as sending a text via SMS." "When money is open, the way we send, spend and receive money will change forever." Ericsson posted on their commerce site "Bitcoin And the Value of Money" which discusses "From Bartering, to Gold, to Bitcoins" Facilitation of Effective Trade, Limited Resources, and Value as a Mutual Agreement. https://letstalkbitcoin.com/ericsson-patents-open-money-for-society

"Local producers are sometimes forced to price goods relative to distant competition, and, because of lower production and wage costs in different parts of the world (or even country), substantially lower profit margins can be the result. There are times, however, when consumers might be willing to buy locally produced goods for the good of the society {Emphasis LTB}, and that attitude is more prevalent today than in the past. But what a consumer says they will do, and what occurs in practical, real shopping situations can be significantly different. Faced with competitive quality products, but disparate prices, the consumer often feels that he or she has no real choice, especially if budgets are more constrained because of uncertain economic conditions, and therefore are not what they used to be. Thus, personal economic pressures can hinder "good" buying decisions. Retailers too are cognizant of an increased awareness for the value of locally produced products. They market local producers and arrange special sections with "good" products, i.e., those that minimally impact the environment both in terms of environmentally friendly manufacturing methods, but also those articles that have been produced locally." "Thus, current economic conditions, and prevailing economic theories make it difficult, if not impossible, for an average consumer to make an impact on the local economy and the local environment, regardless of their attitudes. Therefore, we provide methods for creating a context based payment system.

ERICSSON CONTEXT BASED PAYMENT SYSTEM: "Disclosed herein is a context-based payment system. Electronic currency or coupons can be made dependent on context, and the context can be one of location or geography, time, date, distance, sound, or other devices. The value of the currency exists only if a pre-condition is fulfilled. For example, if the currency is location dependent, the value only exists in a defined area (currency value area). The goods or the service in the value-system are also context dependent, that is, they can only be sold or offered in a defined area (product value area). Accordingly, if the product value area and the currency value area overlap, a purchase and payment can be made."

EQUILIBRIUM ALGORITHM / polynomial-time algorithm by John Nash Princeton University: Nash equilibrium, named after the mathematician John Nash, is the most common way to define the solution of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players. In a Nash equilibrium, each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no one has anything to gain by changing only one's own strategy.[1] The principle of Nash equilibrium dates back to the time of Cournot, who in 1838 applied it to competing firms choosing outputs.[2]

If each player has chosen a strategy – an action plan based on what has happened so far in the game – and no one can increase one's own expected payoff by changing one's strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices constitutes a Nash equilibrium.

If two players Alice and Bob choose strategies A and B, (A, B) is a Nash equilibrium if Alice has no other strategy available that does better than A at maximizing her payoff in response to Bob choosing B, and Bob has no other strategy available that does better than B at maximizing his payoff in response to Alice choosing A. In a game in which Carol and Dan are also players, (A, B, C, D) is a Nash equilibrium if A is Alice's best response to (B, C, D), B is Bob's best response to (A, C, D), and so forth.

Nash showed that there is a Nash equilibrium for every finite game: see further the article on strategy. See: http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~awm/cs288/class3.pdf

FIREFLY-HEARTBEAT ALGORITHM UNIVERSITY of BOLOGNA / HUNGARY: Firefly inspired Heartbeat Synchronization: in a paper entitled Fireﬂy-inspired Heartbeat Synchronization in Overlay Networks by the University of Bologna and Trento Italy along with the University of Szeged, Hungary: “Heartbeat synchronization strives to have nodes in a distributed system generate periodic, local “heartbeat” events approximately at the same time. Many useful distributed protocols rely on the existence of such heartbeats for driving their cycle- based execution. The heartbeat synchronization protocol for overlay networks is inspired by mathematical models of ﬂash synchronization in certain species of ﬁre ﬂies. Nodes send ﬂash messages to their neighbors when a local heartbeat triggers. Fireflies adjust the phase of their next heartbeat based on incoming ﬂash messages using an algorithm inspired by mathematical models of ﬁre-ﬂy synchronization. Heartbeat synchronization strives to have nodes in a distributed system generate periodic, local “heartbeat” events approximately at the same time. It differs from classical clock synchronization in that nodes are not interested in counting cycles and agreeing on a ID of a current cycle. There is no requirement regarding the length of a cycle with respect to real time as long as a length is bounded and all nodes agree on it eventually. The goal is to guarantee that all nodes start and end their cycles at the same time, with an error that is at least one, but preferably more, orders of magnitude smaller than a chosen cycle length.
Firefly heartbeat synchronization reduces uncertainty in stochastic networks.

FIX 4.0 : Heartbeat <0> message: The Heartbeat <0> is useful for monitoring the status of the communication link and to identify when the last of a string of messages was not received. When either end of a FIX connection has not sent any data for [HeartBtInt <108>] seconds, it will transmit a Heartbeat <0> message. When either end of the connection has not received any data for (HeartBtInt <108> + "some reasonable transmission time") seconds, it will transmit a Test Request <1> message. If there is still no Heartbeat <0> message received after (HeartBtInt <108> + "some reasonable transmission time") seconds then the connection should be considered lost and corrective action be initiated. If HeartBtInt <108> is set to zero then no regular Heartbeat <0> messages will be generated. Note that a Test Request <1> message can still be sent independent of the value of the HeartBtInt <108> which will force a Heartbeat <0> message. Heartbeats issued as the result of Test Request <1> must contain the TestReqID <112> transmitted in the Test Request <1> message. This is useful to verify that the Heartbeat <0> is the result of the Test Request <1> and not as the result of a regular timeout. Source: https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/4.0/msgtype_0_0.html

HEARTBEAT: In computer science, a heartbeat is a periodic signal generated by hardware or software to indicate normal operation or to synchronize other parts of a computer system.[1][2] Heartbeat mechanism is one of the common techniques in mission critical systems for providing high availability and fault tolerance of network services by detecting the network or systems failures of nodes or daemons which belongs to a network cluster—administered by a master server—for the purpose of automatic adaptation and rebalancing of the system by using the remaining redundant nodes on the cluster to take over the load of failed nodes for providing constant services.[3][1] Usually a heartbeat is sent between machines at a regular interval in the order of seconds; a heartbeat message.[4] If the endpoint does not receive a heartbeat for a time—usually a few heartbeat intervals—the machine that should have sent the heartbeat is assumed to have failed.[5] Heartbeat messages are typically sent non-stop on a periodic or recurring basis from the originator's start-up until the originator's shutdown. When the destination identifies a lack of heartbeat messages during an anticipated arrival period, the destination may determine that the originator has failed, shutdown, or is generally no longer available.

Heartbeat protocol used to negotiate and monitor the availability of a resource, such as a floating IP address. The procedure involves sending network packets to all the nodes in the cluster to verify its reachability.[3] Typically when a heartbeat starts on a machine, it will perform an election process with other machines on the heartbeat network to determine which machine, if any, owns the resource. On heartbeat networks of more than two machines, it is important to take into account partitioning, where two halves of the network could be functioning but not able to communicate with each other. In a situation such as this, it is important that the resource is only owned by one machine, not one machine in each partition.
As a heartbeat is intended to be used to indicate the health of a machine, it is important that the heartbeat protocol and the transport that it runs on are as reliable as possible. Causing a failover because of a false alarm may, depending on the resource, be highly undesirable. It is also important to react quickly to an actual failure, further signifying the reliability of the heartbeat messages. For this reason, it is often desirable to have a heartbeat running over more than one transport; for instance, an Ethernet segment using UDP/IP, and a serial link.
A "cluster membership" of a node is a property of network reachability: if the master can communicate with the node  it's considered a member of the cluster and "dead" otherwise.[6] A heartbeat program as a whole consist of various subsystems:[7] Heartbeat Subsystem (HS): The subsystem that monitors the node's presence within the cluster through a series of keepalive or "hear-beat messages".
Cluster Manager (CM): The subsystem within the cluster—usually the master server—which keeps track of the "cluster members" and records which resources are on which nodes.
Cluster Transition (CT): When a node joins or leaves the cluster, this subsystem is responsible for keeping track of such occurrences for the purpose of triggering events to rebalancing and reconfiguring the master to distribute the load. Heartbeat messages are sent in a periodic manner through techniques such as broadcast or multicasts in larger clusters.[6] Since CMs have transactions across the cluster, the most common pattern is to send heartbeat messages to all the nodes and "await" responses in non-blocking fashion.[8] Since the heartbeat or keepalive messages are the overwhelming majority of non-application related cluster control messages—which also goes to all the members of the cluster—major critical systems also include non-IP protocols like serial ports to deliver heartbeats.[9] Wikipedia

Heartbeat Message Test Request: FIX 4.0 : Description
The Test Request <1> message is utilized to force a heartbeat from the opposing application. The Test Request <1> message is useful for checking sequence numbers or verifying communication line status. The opposite application will respond to the Test Request <1> with a Heartbeat <0> containing the TestReqID <112>.

The TestReqID <112> is used to verify that the opposite application is generating the heartbeat as the result of Test Request <1> and not a normal timeout. The opposite application will include the TestReqID <112> in the resulting Heartbeat <0>. Any string can be used as the TestReqID <112> (one suggestion is to use a timestamp string).

The hashgraph technology is currently patented, and the only authorized ledger is Hedera Hashgraph. The native cryptocurrency of the Hedera Hashgraph system is HBAR. Unlike blockchains, hashgraphs do not bundle data into blocks or use miners to validate transactions. Instead, hashgraphs use a "gossip about gossip" protocol where the individual nodes on the network "gossip" about transactions to create directed acyclic graphs that time-sequence transactions.[1] Each "gossip" message contains one or more transactions plus a timestamp, a digital signature, and cryptographic hashes of two earlier events. This makes Hashgraph form an asynchronous Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (aBFT) consensus algorithm.[2] Hashgraph was invented by the American computer scientist Leemon Baird.

Hopf Fibration / Bloch sphere: In the mathematical field of differential topology, the Hopf fibration (also known as the Hopf bundle or Hopf map) describes a 3-sphere (a hypersphere in four-dimensional space) in terms of circles and an ordinary sphere. Discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931, it is an influential early example of a fiber bundle. Technically, Hopf found a many-to-one continuous function (or "map") from the 3-sphere onto the 2-sphere such that each distinct point of the 2-sphere is mapped from a distinct great circle of the 3-sphere (Hopf 1931).[1] Thus the 3-sphere is composed of fibers, where each fiber is a circle — one for each point of the 2-sphere. The Hopf fibration has many implications, some purely attractive, others deeper. For example, stereographic projection S3 → R3 induces a remarkable structure in R3, which in turn illuminates the topology of the bundle (Lyons 2003). Stereographic projection preserves circles and maps the Hopf fibers to geometrically perfect circles in R3 which fill space. Here there is one exception: the Hopf circle containing the projection point maps to a straight line in R3 — a "circle through infinity". The fibers over a circle of latitude on S2 form a torus in S3 (topologically, a torus is the product of two circles) and these project to nested toruses in R3 which also fill space. The individual fibers map to linking Villarceau circles on these tori, with the exception of the circle through the projection point and the one through its opposite point: the former maps to a straight line, the latter to a unit circle perpendicular to, and centered on, this line, which may be viewed as a degenerate torus whose minor radius has shrunken to zero. Every other fiber image encircles the line as well, and so, by symmetry, each circle is linked through every circle, both in R3 and in S3. Two such linking circles form a Hopf link in R3Hopf proved that the Hopf map has Hopf invariant 1, and therefore is not null-homotopic. In fact it generates the homotopy group π3(S2) and has infinite order. In quantum mechanics, the Riemann sphere is known as the Bloch sphere, and the Hopf fibration describes the topological structure of a quantum mechanical two-level system or qubit. Similarly, the topology of a pair of entangled two-level systems is given by the Hopf fibration. See USPTO 13/573,002 water drop in pond, Paul Revere linear sequential (line) memes.

Financial Standard ISO 20022 is a International Standard prepared by ISO Technical Committee TC68 Financial Services. It describes a common platform for the development of messages in ASN.1 Abstract Syntax Notation: A single standardization approach (methodology, process, repository) to be used by all financial standards initiatives. It is a common platform for the development of messages using:
- a modelling methodology to capture in a syntax-independent way financial business areas, business transactions and associated message flows
- a central dictionary of business items used in financial communications
- a set of XML and ASN.1 design rules to convert the message models into XML or ASN.1 schemas, when use of the ISO 20022 XML or ASN.1-based syntax is preferred. 
The resulting models and derived messages are published in the Catalogue of messages and stored in the ISO 20022 Financial Repository available on this website. This flexible framework allows communities of users and message development organizations to define message sets according to an internationally agreed approach using internationally agreed business semantics and, whenever desirable, to migrate to the use of a common XML or ASN.1-based syntax.

Gross national income (GNI), previously known as gross national product (GNP), is the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country, consisting of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), plus factor incomes earned by foreign residents, minus income earned in the domestic economy by nonresidents (Todaro & Smith, 2011: 44).[2] Comparing GNI to GDP shows the degree to which a nation's GDP represents domestic or international activity.

The 365-day orbit of Earth around the Sun naturally divides into thirteen 28-day sequences (13×28=364) which correspond to the thirteen lunations occurring during one solar year, plus one extra day, July 25, the Day Out of Time, a day to practice time is art and peace through culture. Its daily use helps entrain the mind into the threshold of galactic consciousness. The 13 Moon/28-day calendar embraces and synchronizes all true calendrical and mathematical systems, from lunar calendars, to the Mayan long count, to the Elder Futhark runes, to the I Ching hexagrams. In other words, this system reveals a master matrix, which contains all other systems. In the Gregorian calendar there is little cyclic or periodic order. Months are uneven; the length of months does not correlate with number of seven-day weeks, and the numbers change every month. https://lawoftime.org/education/

This method holds that the skill of individual players isn’t what makes or breaks a team; in the long run, the goal is to make sure that each necessary skill is accounted for, whether by one player or four. The team will work like a clock, with each cog serving its own purpose (no matter how hopeless they may be at another area).. crafting a team while staying within a meager budget.

NAMED DATA NETWORKING NDN NEXT GENERATION INTERNET: Named-data networking focus is on content caching to reduce congestion and improve delivery speed, simpler configuration of network devices, and building security into the network at the data level. Types of Packets: Communication in NDN is driven by receivers i.e., data consumers, through the exchange of two types of packets: Interest and Data. Both types of packets carry a name that identiﬁes a piece of data transmitted in one Data packet. Overview of the Packet Contents for NDN Packet: NAMED DATA NETWORK INTEREST: A consumer puts name of a desired piece of data into an Interest packet and sends it to network. Routers use name to forward Interest query toward data producer(s). Data: Once Interest packet reaches a node that has the requested data, the node will return a Data packet that contains both the name and the content, together with a signature by the producer’s key which binds the two. This Data packet follows in reverse the path taken by requesting consumer’s interest. NDN Distance packet.

“Nature may reach the same result in many ways. Like a wave in the physical world, in the infinite ocean of the medium which pervades all, so in the world of organisms, in life, an impulse started proceeds onward, at times, may be, with the speed of light, at times, again, so slowly that for ages and ages it seems to stay, passing through processes of a complexity inconceivable to men, but in all its forms, in all its stages, its energy ever and ever integrally present. A single ray of light from a distant star falling upon the eye of a tyrant in bygone times may have altered the course of his life, may have changed the destiny of nations, may have transformed the surface of the globe, so intricate, so inconceivably complex are the processes in Nature. In no way can we get such an overwhelming idea of the grandeur of Nature than when we consider, that in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy, throughout the Infinite, the forces are in a perfect balance, and hence the energy of a single thought may determine the motion of a universe.” ― Nikola Tesla

Open Telemetry OTEL: Observability has made it possible for both developers and operators to gain that visibility into their systems. In order to make a system observable, it must be instrumented. That is, the code must emit traces, metrics, and logs. The instrumented data must then be sent to an Observability back-end.
OpenTracing vendor-neutral API for sending telemetry data to an Observability back-end; it relied on developers to implement their own libraries to meet the specification.
OpenCensus provided a set of language-specific libraries that developers could use to instrument their code and send to any one of their supported back-ends.
-	single, vendor-agnostic instrumentation library per language with support for both automatic and manual instrumentation.
-	single vendor-neutral collector binary that can be deployed in a variety of ways.
-	generate, emit, collect, process, export telemetry data end-to-end.

OPERAND PROGRAMMABLE MONEY: Operand - “In mathematics, an operand is the object of a mathematical operation, a quantity on which an operation is performed.”
“In computing, an operand is the part of a computer instruction that specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.”

In Operand, the transactional unit carries the execution methods and parameters that apply to the units of currency involved for that transaction. Operand is programmable money that brings the utility of everyday banking features to the unbanked and underbanked and empowers their adoption through the automata of the Operand protocol. Operand is a currency that functions as a seamless and embedded economic layer on the web that serves as the technological underlay for payments, decentralized exchange, digital asset invocation and transfer, and smart contract issuance and execution. By embedding the instruction set of the transaction into the transaction metadata, the blockchain itself serves as the interpreter for programmed transactions. Operand creates utilities such as direct debit payments or even standing orders. Operand is trustless and non-retractable whilst being fully accountable and transparent on the public ledger. The programmable aspect enables further security on every transaction as the clients must reach network consensus on the method of execution. Smart contracts can then be forged on all aspects of exchange.

PAUL REVERE LINEAR-SEQUENTIAL MEME

The Paul Revere linear-sequential meme – metaphor is a physical, historical meme used instead of an abstract metaphor that the internet uses called TCP/IP “hop counts”. 

Hop Counts: (123): Hops are linear and sequential referring to applicant's Paul Revere 
meme (126). Hops are described / defined from null as a condition / state: stationary, inactive. Hops are changes in location from point a to point b to point n. Hops follow a base running paradigm in the main embodiment (131) and are referential to TCP/IP in embodiment 1. Hops are counted incrementally where hops are changes in location e.g., home plate to first, second, and third base and back to home base (131).  Hop metrics are incremental changes from null 0,1,2,3,4 - N (126) that may be positive or negative values. Hop counts are used to equitably meter, measure and derive performance or effectiveness metrics, meters. 

Time stamps (112) form time frames, temporally bound hops e.g., in time and space.  Erlang logic is useful in establishing time boundaries and time limits among geo-spatially disperse events. Time filtered and spatially metered reports are comprised of state meta-data snapshot / heartbeat message / sync delta messages where state meta data is harvested during micro-cycles then posted / displayed during longer macro-cycles.

Pneumatic computer uses pressure instead of electricity: A computer chip made of glass and silicone holds liquids that move from one side of the chip to the other in reaction to pressure changes. This has been used to control and automate miniaturized biochemistry experiments A pneumatic computer made of glass and silicone uses pressure instead of electricity to encode data. It can enable a chip-sized device to perform procedures that are usually done by technicians in labs. They sandwiched a sheet of silicone 0.25 millimeters thick between two thin panes of glass. They etched tiny channels into the glass so that liquids needed for chemical reactions could flow through them, and then punched small holes into the silicone layer to connect channels between the two panes.

Price Discovery Patent Application: 0160358256 [0056 In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, the amount of an investment required from a speculator is calculated by executing the following cost of speculation equation: V.intg.|log(P)-log(.DELTA.P)|/R dt. The variables for the cost of speculation equation are as follows: P represents a variable of price, P(t) is a variable function of price over time in a given market, .DELTA.P represent a speculative price function. P(t) can mathematically represent the future prices as functions of price over time. The function value of R(t) is a predetermined value for the rate of return. For example, for R(t), the value can be 100% annualized so for a t in years R(1)=2, R(2)=4 and R(0.5)=1.414, but as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, any function is possible. The value for V(t) at any given time is the expected value to the market (e.g., volume of goods to trade multiplied by the market commission) The value for V(t) can be updated empirically as the commodities market functions by calculation as a moving average of volume times the markets total transactional overhead charge.

Quantum annealing starts from a quantum-mechanical superposition of all possible states (candidate states) with equal weights. Then the system evolves following the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, a natural quantum-mechanical evolution of physical systems. The amplitudes of all candidate states keep changing, realizing a quantum parallelism, according to the time-dependent strength of the transverse field, which causes quantum tunneling between states. If the rate of change of the transverse field is slow enough, the system stays close to the ground state of the instantaneous Hamiltonian (also see adiabatic quantum computation).[6] If the rate of change of the transverse field is accelerated, the system may leave the ground state temporarily but produce a higher likelihood of concluding in the ground state of the final problem Hamiltonian, i.e., diabatic quantum computation.[7][8] The transverse field is finally switched off, and the system is expected to have reached the ground state of the classical Ising model that corresponds to the solution to the original optimization problem. An experimental demonstration of the success of quantum annealing for random magnets was reported immediately after the initial theoretical proposal.[9]

Quantum Computing Science Alert: The latest invention follows the team's creation of the first ever quantum transistor in 2012. (A transistor is a small device that controls electronic signals and forms just one part of a computer circuit. An integrated circuit is more complex as it puts lots of transistors together.) To make this leap in quantum computing, the researchers used a scanning tunneling microscope in an ultra-high vacuum to place quantum dots with sub-nanometer precision. The placement of each quantum dot needed to be just right so the circuit could mimic how electrons hop along a string of single- and double-bonded carbons in a polyacetylene molecule. Relevance: 

QRNB: QUANTUM RANDOM NUMBER BEACON NIST:  uses two independent sources of randomness, each with an independent hardware entropy source and SP 800-90-approved components. The Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability, autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are made available by the source. Autonomy means that the source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a set of users can access the source all receiving the same random string. The Beacon broadcasts full-entropy bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds. Each value is time-stamped and signed and includes the hash of the previous value to chain the sequence of values together. This prevents all, even the source, from retroactively changing an output packet without being detected. The beacon keeps all output packets and makes them available online. The Beacon periodically outputs a pulse containing 512 fresh random bits, time-stamped, signed and hash-chained. For example, each pulse also pre-commits to the randomness to be released in the next pulse. The latter enables users to securely combine randomness from different beacons. The Beacon protocol also specifies the interface for users to interact with the Beacon, in order to obtain information about past pulses. A randomness beacon produces timed outputs of fresh public randomness. Each output, called a pulse, includes metadata / cryptographic elements. The main goal of the NIST Random # Beacon is to serve as a baseline for deployment of many interoperable beacons NIST: http://nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/nist_beacon.cfm

Quantum Random Number Generator QRNB: The NIST method generates digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons, or particles of light, using data generated in an improved version of a landmark 2015 NIST physics experiment.

QUANTUM COMPUTING VIA Sound Waves QUANTUM ACOUSTICS

Good vibrations for quantum computing Amy Navarathna & Warwick P. Bowen
Similar to the photons that make up beams of light, indivisible quantum particles called phonons make up a beam of sound. These particles emerge from the collective motion of quadrillions of atoms, much as a "stadium wave" in a sports arena is due to the motion of thousands of individual fans. When you listen to a song, you're hearing a stream of these very small quantum particles. Originally conceived to explain the heat capacities of solids, phonons are predicted to obey the same rules of quantum mechanics as photons. The technology to generate and detect individual phonons has, however, lagged behind that for photons. Technology being developed, in part by my research group at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. We are exploring the fundamental quantum properties of sound by splitting phonons in half and entangling them together. Nature Physics volume 18, pages736–738 (2022) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01613-z
Quantum Computing Vibrations encode, process data like quantum computers. A simple mechanical system built from aluminum rods uses vibrations to encode information, mimicking quantum computing in a non-quantum system. Some properties of quantum computers can be imitated with sound trapped in a simple mechanical device. This has the advantage of being less fragile than quantum computers, while still replicating some of their properties. Quantum computers could eventually solve problems that are impossible for the best conventional supercomputers, but they are tricky to work with. Many lose their quantumness, which is key for their advantages over ordinary computers, and stop working very quickly because of disturbances from their environments. propose using tiny mechanical vibrations. The atoms are coupled via phonons—the smallest quantum mechanical units of vibrations or sound waves. / USPTO 13/573,002 water drop in pond meme

SOUND ACOUSTIC WAVES FOR QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
Acoustic system that gives us the possibility creating these Bell states," Deymier said. "It's the complete analog to quantum mechanics." Demonstrating that this is possible has opened the door to applying classical nonseparability to the emerging field of phononics. Next, the researchers will work to increase the number of degrees of freedom that can be classically entangled -- the more, the better. They also want to develop algorithms that can use these nonseparable states to manipulate information.

QUANTUM COMPUTING via acoustic waves at room temperature

Analog / digital computing origins are based on (electromagnetic - radio) waves as is energy transmission whether wired or wireless. Sound is an emerging quantum computing option for example: Sound of the future: A new analog to quantum computing: Engineers are using soundwaves to search through big data with more stability and ease. Researchers have demonstrated the possibility for acoustic waves in a classical environment to do the work of quantum information processing without the time limitations and fragility. https://lnkd.in/gbpStiqv Date: September 19, 2019

Quantum Vibrations via Diamonds / Silicon atoms: "We are testing tiny diamonds with built-in silicon atoms—these quantum systems are particularly promising," says Professor Peter Rabl from TU Wien. "Normally, diamonds are made exclusively of carbon, but adding silicon atoms in certain places creates defects in the crystal lattice where quantum information can be stored." These microscopic flaws in the crystal lattice can be used like tiny switches that can be toggled between a state of higher energy and a state of lower energy using microwaves. Together with a team from Harvard University, Peter Rabl's research group has developed a new idea to achieve the targeted coupling of these quanta within the diamond. One by one, they can be built into a tiny diamond rod measuring only a few micrometers in length, like individual pearls on a necklace. Just like a tuning fork, this rod can then be made to vibrate—however, these vibrations are so small that they can only be described using quantum theory. It is through these vibrations that the silicon atoms can form a quantum-mechanical link to each other. "Light is made from photons, the quantum of light. In the same way, mechanical vibrations or sound waves can also be described in a quantum-mechanical manner. They are composed of phonons: the smallest possible units of mechanical vibration," explains Peter Rabl, any number of these quanta can be linked together in the diamond rod via phonons. The individual silicon atoms are switched on and off using microwaves. During this process, silicon atoms emit or absorb phonons. This creates a quantum entanglement of the silicon defects, thus allowing quantum information to be transferred. The main advantage of this new technology lies in its scalability. The strategy of using the smallest unit of mechanical vibration phonons for this purpose could pave the way to a scalable quantum technology. Link: https://phys.org/news/2018-06-quantum_1.html /

ROSETTA STONE SYNTAX LIBRARY LEXICON CODE GUIDE REGISTRY
The Rosetta Stone is a rock stele, found in 1799, inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V. The decree appears in three scripts: the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the middle portion is Demotic script, and the lowest is Ancient Greek. Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts (with some minor differences among them), the stone provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs. It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, and it aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic language. Lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholars.

Symbolic artificial intelligence: is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search.[1] Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems), symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, the strengths. imitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.

Physical symbol system (also called a formal system) takes physical patterns (symbols), combining them into structures (expressions) and manipulating them (using processes) to produce new expressions. The physical symbol system hypothesis (PSSH) is a position in the philosophy of artificial intelligence formulated by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. They wrote: A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action."[2] — Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon

This claim implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence).[3] The idea has philosophical roots in Hobbes (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), Leibniz (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas), Hume (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even Kant (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules).[1] The latest version is called the computational theory of mind, associated with philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor.[4 Source: Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system

TOKENS / TOKENIZATION // DISTRIBUTED STATE MACHINES
"Distributed state machines have proven incredibly resilient architecture for value transfer which now supports over $1.6trn of total on-chain asset value, with real-world assets making up less than 10% ($132bn). However, the total value of on-chain assets pales in comparison with the off-chain traditional assets. To put this in perspective, a 1bps (0.01%) daily increase in the total off-chain traditional asset market value is equivalent to the entire on-chain real-world asset market doubling overnight"

"The emergent programmable on-chain asset class can support much more than its own weight, enabling faster and cheaper value transfer rails has the potential to be the settlement layer for existing off-chain real-world assets. In addition, public ledgers enable greater asset transparency and liquidity, thus reducing investor risk and borrower cost of capital. A holy grail of any capital market participants. This opportunity is most evident in real-world asset tokenization".
The next wave of evolutionary change in traditional financial markets and beyond is taking us from physical analog to virtual digital. Driven by standardization (SWIFT, ERC20), decreased settlement times and settlement cost". "Tokenization, an evolution of securitization, is a real-world use case for encoding existing off-chain asset metadata in a digital token state. This new tokenization paradigm will increase asset liquidity, lower distribution costs and reduce settlement times. The value of increased capital efficiency is increasingly relevant in light of higher opportunity cost of elevated money market rates".
 
The next phase in RWAs will focus on overcoming the challenges of scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance. Scalability will be key in managing the sheer volume of transactions that the incorporation of RWAs into blockchain networks will bring. Interoperability between different blockchain platforms will enable a seamless and efficient transfer of assets, enhancing liquidity and market efficiency.SOURCE: The Real World Asset Thesis: The Next Generation of Traditional Financial Markets Arete Research MCKENNA JAN 15 2024

TRADE REFERENCE CURRENCY TRC 
Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer proposed a commodity based TRC Trade Reference Currency based on demurrage charges to support logistics of goods moved from supplier to consumer called the TERRA TRC. The Terra TRC Trade Reference Currency is a global complementary currency designed to provide an inflation-resistant international standard of value; to stabilize the business cycle on a global level; and to realign stockholder’s interests with long-term sustainability. From a legal viewpoint, the Terra is standardized “countertrade” (international barter), which is routinely used for over one trillion dollars worth of transactions per year. Legislation on countertrade exists in about two hundred countries, including all the major trading nations. 
The Terra is a CC complimentary currency that would be issued by a nation’s central bank. As outlined by Lietaer in his seminal “A ‘Green’ Convertible Currency”, what we will have is a “commodity-based currency, for a New Currency backed by a basket of from three to a dozen different commodities for which there are existing international commodity markets. For instance, 100 New Currency could be worth 0.05 ounces of gold, plus 3 ounces of silver, plus 15 pounds of copper, plus 1 barrel of oil, plus 5 pounds of wool.” This CC/new money is therefore backed by the valuation of the commodities in the basket at the value of the national currency of the society it originates from. So in the US, the value of the basket, in terms of USD, will determine the exchange rate between those trading in USD for the Terra in America. The Terra would work in tandem with the national currency and is not a new money that supplants everything else in its wake. As the Terra TRC (Trade Reference Currency) White Paper by Takashi Kiuchi, Chairman of The Future 500, states: “The Terra is designed as a complementary currency operating in parallel with national currencies. Therefore, everything that exists today as monetary and financial products or practices continues to exist. The Terra mechanism is only one additional option available for those international economic actors who voluntarily choose to use it.”  SOURCE: https://www.lietaer.com/2010/01/terra/

TIME CRYSTALS: physicist Frank Wilczek in 2012, is a phase of matter which repeats in time, similar to how a regular crystal's structure repeats in space. What that means is that the particles in the crystal perpetually switch between two states without requiring the input of more energy and without losing any energy. These crystals are the first objects to break what is known as "time-translation symmetry," a rule in physics that states that a stable object will remain unchanged throughout time. Time crystals avoid this rule, being both stable and ever-changing.

WATER DROP IN POND MEME USPTO 13/573,002

“Water drop in pond meme directs to a detailed treatises describing geo-spatial temporal intensity metrics and meters using sonar in water as opposed to a TCP/IP internet ping. Reasons for this distinction is that sonar wave behavior in water used by naval military units is well known while a TCP/IP internet “ping” is an abstract metaphor formed by time intervals / cycles / epochs / CPU clock intervals that are used to process / not process instructions describing distances between internet nodes. 

Water Drop in Pond area, circular, circumference metaphor – meme: areas defined by radius / circumference (124) are described in terms of radii within a circumference of a circle used to encompass or encircle a cluster of players, teams, or leagues into a discrete set.  Resource items are typed, classified by <tags> measured from a known reference point i.e. ten-digit map grid coordinate describing a limited or bounded geo-spatial area described by concentric rings /circles shown to expand or contract with threshold metric changes denoting intensity i.e., an earthquake occurs during game with pre / aftershocks. Wave crests and troughs are converted into analog integer equivalents where amplitude and frequency changes convey event intensity, duration as thresholds. Discrete wave crest to trough phase changes are summed. Wave crests and troughs define cycles in terms of on, off, duration and describe slowing and speeding up of events, activities occurring within the circular geo-spatial area containing items of interest --see geo-spatial area entries, in related art for treatises. 

Radius searches performed within circumference (124) use <tags> as search key tag / word targets. Search results are filtered and processed by tag classes and types then saved as search results time tagged with the micro-cycle heartbeat timestamp (112) running concurrently within and assisting with the formation of a self-organizing reporting cycle in a macro-cycle as part of a Heart Beacon Cycle (137). Radius searches are conducted to discover threshold, duration and intensity conditions changes useful in precedence processing parameters i.e., flash override, flash, immediate, priority routine shown on appliqué acetate overlay display boards (134).

Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) in Space
 
Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) (we can) calculate the Doppler shifts of the in and out waves for relative motion. The WSM directly deduces both the de Broglie wave and the mass increase in the solution to these Doppler shifted waves (mathematical physicist Professor Milo Wolff deduced this). This is remarkable, just one deduction is enough for all scientists to take this very seriously.
Copenhagen (Probability Wave Function) Interpretation Vs de Broglie / Bohm Non-Local Determinism. The de Broglie wave is a non local phase wave, where its phase velocity = C^2 / relative velocity. If the relative velocity is one thousandth the speed of light C, then the de Broglie phase wave has a velocity of 1000C. And now we can solve this strangeness of the probability wave (Copenhagen) interpretation of quantum physics. For example, in the two slit experiment it is assumed that a particle 'transforms' into a probability wave, interferes through the two slits, and when observed on the screen, the probability wave function 'collapses' back to a particle. Both Einstein and Schrodinger thought this was just a mathematical solution, that the real cause of the probability was lack of knowledge of a connected system (they were correct), and that it was insane to think the probability wave was real (that led to Schrodinger's cat, which cannot be both alive and dead at the same time). And yet the probability wave had to be real to interfere through the slits. David Bohm who found the solution. He showed that you get the same probability function if reality is deterministic, but there must be a non-local hidden variable, what he called the pilot wave, that affects the experiment. However, rather than just postulating that a particle is guided by a non local pilot wave, we have now deduced that these spherical standing waves create a non local phase wave that affects their behavior. Einstein partly liked Bohm's solution, it removed the probability wave, but introduced non locality that contradicted his relativity. Einstein's error relates to his incorrect foundation of representing matter as continuous fields in space time, rather than discrete standing waves in space thus also explaining discrete quantum effects that Einstein could not explain with his continuous fields, explained by relativity.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
It is actually common knowledge that the uncertainty principle is a wave phenomena. In simplistic terms, if you know the position of a wave then you do not know its motion or wavelength, and if you know its motion and wavelength then you do not know its position. Secondly, to make an observation of a standing wave particle, you must have a wave interaction with that standing wave, which changes its position and motion.

Spin: Spin is intriguing and gets a little complex, as we need to understand the Euler formula e^ix = cosx + i sinx, since Schrodinger used this relationship to generate rotating waves. What most people don't realize is that the formula shows that if you have two plane waves 90 degrees out of phase (sin and cos), and one is rotated 90 degrees to the other (using the imaginary number i), then the resultant of these two intersecting plane waves is a circularly rotating phase wave. So it is possible that our spherical standing wave has this spherical rotation of the in and out waves, creating the electron spin. I have written a second essay on this, also important, as it relates to Euler's number, and its connection to spherical geometry and physical reality, which explains the physical foundations of mathematics, why mathematics is so good at describing physical reality.
See; https://www.spaceandmotion.com/euler-equation.htm

Unification of the Fundamental Forces (Charge / Light, Gravity)
Let us now put our one law to work to explain and unite charge, light and gravity, since all matter interactions (causal connection) are a result of this one law, bigger waves travel faster. (Though this is now obvious to me, it took me 25 years to realise that causal connection must involve a change in velocity, since acceleration is always involved in matter interactions, as per newton's law of inertia, Force = Mass * Acceleration.)

Charge
When an in phase plane wave flows through a high wave amplitude wave center, the wave travels faster and the wave front is advanced (hill). This occurs between electrons, and also between positrons, and the result of this advanced wave is that it causes electrons to repel one another, and positrons to repel one another (each advanced 'hill' on the wave front acts like a small 'push' when it flows through another standing wave, see below).
However, if you have an electron and a positron interacting, then the waves are opposite phase, cancel one another, the total wave amplitude is lower, the wave travels more slowly, causing a retarded wave front (hollow), and this causes opposite phase standing waves (electrons and positrons) to attract one another.

Light and the 'Electromagnetic Wave'
If the electron is bound in an atom or molecule, then it has a repeating wave pattern, and this pattern of advanced 'hills' on successive plane waves forms a wave pattern that is the cause of the 'electromagnetic' light wave. It is a resonance phenomenon, where the pattern of advanced curves must match the standing wave pattern of the electron it interacts with (like pushing a swing, you must push at the correct phase for the swing to absorb the energy and swing higher). The energy is discrete (quanta / photon) because the change from one standing wave pattern to another is discrete. de Broglie first proposed this, without understanding the true wave mechanism behind it (he worked with a particle wave duality for matter).
Acceleration and Ellipsoidal Geometry
A stationary standing wave in space is perfectly spherical. The diagram below shows this and why Pythagoras theorem is a property of spheres. However, if the incoming plane wave from one direction has an advanced 'hill' on the surface of the wave, then this causes the stationary standing wave to move in the direction of the 'hill', and it changes its shape from spherical to ellipsoidal (like an egg!).
In the diagram below, imagine the incoming plane waves from the left have an advanced hill on them, this then changes the ellipsoidal shape of the standing wave and it begins to move to the right.

The ellipsoidal wave is stretched in the direction of motion (right side), thus the same wave energy is spread over a larger surface area and has a lower wave amplitude and thus velocity and wavelength, as per our one law. On the opposite side the effects are reversed, the ellipsoidal wave is squashed, has a smaller surface area, a higher wave amplitude, the wave travels faster and has a longer wavelength. This changing ellipsoidal geometry and wavelength / velocity is the foundation of inertia, since when you accelerate the standing wave, its resultant ellipsoidal shape changes, as does the in wave velocity which is slower in the direction of motion, faster on the opposite side, which then maintains its new velocity through space.
Importantly, the Lorentz Transformations have the electron becoming a squashed ellipsoid on both sides with motion, whereas the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) has the electron as a stretched ellipsoid in the direction of motion (with slower in waves and shorter wavelength) and a squashed ellipsoid on the opposite side (with faster in waves and longer wavelength. This difference in ellipsoidal geometry from one side to the other is the foundation of the Doppler effect, magnetic moment, and also the Lorentz transformations and Einstein's general relativity. Note - Perhaps there is some experiment that could distinguish between Lorentz's squashed ellipsoid Vs the WSM where it is stretched in the direction of motion.
Most profoundly, we now have a physical reason for why acceleration is related to curvature and ellipsoidal geometry, since whenever a wave changes velocity there is a change in ellipsoidal curvature of the wave front (Einstein's matter-energy curves space-time). However, Einstein changed the length and time when he should have changed the length and wave velocity and kept the time (frequency) constant. In this way, even though the velocity of the waves changes, so does the wavelength such that you always measure the same velocity of light (which is also why Pythagoras' Theorem is true irrespective of motion and ellipsoidal geometry).

Gravity: To understand how gravity is united with light we must first understand where all the antimatter / positrons are, since positrons and electrons (opposite phase standing waves) are created equally, and both contribute to gravity. Positrons are naturally produced due to radioactive decay of certain isotopes, and can be artificially produced using high energy laser beams fired at gold. In Beta+ decay the proton emits a positron and becomes a neutron, likewise, the neutron can emit an electron and become a proton in Beta- decay. The obvious conclusion from this is that positrons and electrons make up the structure of the proton, with one extra positron to account for the positive charge. What this exact structure is is unknown, but if the quark theory of protons is correct then the quarks are most likely positronium (a bound positron and electron). However, this exact structure of protons and neutrons is not needed, all we need to know is that in a neutral atom there are equal numbers of positrons and electrons. So now let us consider a plane wave flowing through a large body like the Earth, that has roughly the same number of positrons as electrons. If the plane waves are in phase with the electrons then they will get an advanced curve (hill) on their wavefront, and they will get a retarded curve (hollow) when travelling through positrons. The result is that you get as many advanced curves as retarded curves, and they will cancel one another out. i.e. It is a neutral body and there is no charge effect. And now finally we can unite light and gravity (though it took me 20+ years to work this out, even though it is simple and obvious, deduced from our one law). The solution. When the plane waves have advanced or retarded curves on their wave front, then the same wave energy is spread over a larger surface area, so the curved part of the wave front has a smaller wave amplitude, and thus a slower wave velocity. Thus an advanced curve will get smaller over time: the 'push force' decreases the further the wave travels through space), the retarded curve will do the opposite and get bigger over time (the 'pull force' increases the further the wave travels through space). So the push and pull 'forces' of advanced and retarded curves on the plane waves do not exactly cancel each other out, instead, there must always be a slight attractive force due to the slowing of the curved wave fronts due to our one law. This slight attractive force is the cause of gravity. What remains to be done is for mathematical physicists to calculate this relationship between wave amplitude, wave velocity, and ellipsoidal curvature. Einstein was correct to relate gravity to ellipsoidal curvature, but we now need to correct the error of Einstein working from continuous fields in space-time rather than discrete standing waves in space, and his changing of time rather than wave velocity as occurs with the Wave Structure of Matter. And please excuse my rather abrupt ending. I am currently writing this essay on my boat in Tahiti, but today set sail for Samoa, and I wanted to get this online before leaving.

1. US Supreme Court Ruling Alice Corp V CLS Bank: "claims ineligible for patent protection                 under 35 U. S. C. §101 "directed to an abstract idea" http://1.usa.gov/1V91pQe LINK

2. 13/573,002 achieves Supreme Court Alice Corp V CLS Bank compliance via a Little League Baseball Tournament physical meme embodiment. Physical, tangible memes are applied. 

3. Supreme Court Alice Corp V CLS Bank applies greater weight than Transco V Performance
Ultimately, only the date when the best, most useful meme was filed matters. There is no point in establishing dates of other filings that have been superseded by a superior ruling

4. USPTO screen captures establish a patent worthy idea is formed at the exact instant of capture. The only method to protect intellectual property is patent assignment. Once a patent worthy idea is deemed formed, a court may not reverse itself. Stare decisis et not queta movera.

5. All internet artifacts are formed using time epochs, cycles, intervals, periods to process or not process syntax as instructions. 10/605,144, 10/708,000 establish this idea / fact. Metaphorical terms “ping”, “hop”, “packet”, “frames”, “Bitcoin”, “blockchain” “transactor chip” are described in baseball terms. “Incomprehensible” opinion due to USPTO examination of treatise language 

6. All materials submitted after 10/605,144, 10/708,000 Jan 30, 2004 are theme, use case variants. No materials submitted after 10/708,000 may be considered “new” given this fact, truth. 

7. USPTO cites 12/856,715 to examine 13/573,002 claims. 12/856,715 is labeled as a parent document and abandoned. USPTO must choose a condition, 12/856,715 cannot be both.
 
8. USPTO states applicants must submit an amendment and USPTO states application is final. USPTO must choose a condition, 13,573,002 cannot be both requiring an amendment / final.

9. Transco V Performance Contracting Inc. screen captures suspend USPTO procedures and methods redirecting examination outside USPTO PAIR system. Re-direction outside PAIR suspends expectation of applicant’s skill. USPTO lacks skill outside USPTO PAIR. 

10.	No date, time stamps on USPTO screen captures creates temporal ambiguity.

An adaptive procedural template is a checklist where items on the checklist may be added or removed and replaced by items considered to be more useful or superior. Most of the items are intrinsic to DARPA, DOD system of systems engineering internet development supporting data digitial dashboard operations in use over decades. An improvement to an invention may be itself considered to be an invention such as the firefly inspired heartbeat algorithm with it’s instrinsic heartbeat message event bus. If a superior algorithm is found then this algorithm replaces the old algorithm and so on

FIGURE 14: Code Syntax Lexicon, Message Template Library 

Blockchain developers use alpha-numeric brevity OPSCODES to describe commodities or fungible goods or items that represent fungible stores of value.  Military NATO bases are small cities that transact a range of goods, commodities, fungible items that are described by computer codes – OPSCODES that are matched with systemically, procedurally generated symbols and 2525 A, B, C, D standard series symbol sets essential to man – machine – computer Artificial Intelligence A.I. This disciplined effort took decades and thousands of man hours to develop and refine. Why reinvent this syntax lexicon library wheel with every new cryptocurrency blockchain startup ?

Structured military messaging involves identifying use cases as messages and message sets commonly used to accomplish tasks that are identified by number. Data elements or Field Form Identifiers Reference Numbers or FFIRNS and Field Unit Designators as three and four digit codes unambiguously identify the use of the data element in number forms. Three and four digit codes in turn refer to text descriptions referencing symbols in symbol libraries / databases. Messages are processed, parsed in - out of distributed database. Syntax / symbol source libraries that need a common reference format include as a minimum:

•	Named-Data Networking NDN Centric Networking (XML tags)
•	OASIS TOSCA YAML document indent data encoding scheme
•	GITHUB code, syntax library, Java Script OS (“tag”} convention..

World Financial Standard ISO 20022 is a multi-part International Standard prepared by ISO Technical Committee TC68 Financial Services. It describes a common platform for the development of messages in ASN.1 Abstract Syntax Notation: A single standardization approach (methodology, process, repository) to be used by all financial standards initiatives. common platform for the development of messages using:
• a modelling methodology to capture in a syntax-independent way financial business areas, business transactions and associated message flows
• a central dictionary of business items used in financial communications
• a set of XML and ASN.1 design rules to convert the message models into XML or ASN.1 schemas, whenever the use of the ISO 20022 XML or ASN.1-based syntax is preferred ISO 20022: https://www.iso20022.org/about-iso-20022

Figure 18: Discovery Machine Symbolic Artificial Intelligence / USPTO 13/573,002

Symbolic artificial intelligence: is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search.[1] Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems), symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, the strengths. imitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems. Physical symbol system (also called a formal system) takes physical patterns (symbols), combining them into structures (expressions) and manipulating them (using processes) to produce new expressions. The physical symbol system hypothesis (PSSH) is a position in the philosophy of artificial intelligence formulated by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. They wrote: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action."[2] — Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon

This claim implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence).[3]

The idea has philosophical roots in Hobbes (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), Leibniz (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas), Hume (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even Kant (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules).[1] The latest version is called the computational theory of mind, associated with philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor.[4 Source: Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system

THESIS: All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:
1.	Time epochs created by oscillating quartz crystal silicon chips
2.	Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles
All things internet, net of money blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast protocols. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast and workflow filters. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Internet 3.0 and the new web will be based on the original structure and an Adaptive Procedural Template described by Stanford University. There are no packets, frames, layers, blocks, shards, graphs, hash graphs “bots”, “motes”.. or Satoshi's traversing the net, stored in a blockchain cube.

Figure 20: Blockchain Tri-lemma Quad-lemma / Net, net of Money ground truth

— The perfect blockchain has three elements: Security, decentralization, and scalability. Finding a balance between the three is difficult and presents a problem referred to as the blockchain trilemma.

— Scalability and decentralization are often held back by security, but security tends to be compromised by any shifts on a network that offer scalability.

— Projects either choose to focus on two out of three or work on finding a solution to tackle the trilemma once and for all. Innovative ideas like sharding, side-chains and state channels are used to address the trilemma but they’re still experimental.

— A solution to the problem could lead to greater adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain and a wide-spread use of the technology across industries.

In reality, Terms like blockchain, levels, (side) chains are epoch cycles created after the genesis block that is an epoch time interval, cycle produced by (silicon chip) oscillations.

Figure 25: STRATML Markup Language

Strategy Markup Language (StratML) is an XML-based standard vocabulary and schema for the information commonly contained in strategic and performance plans and reports. StratML Part 1 specifies the elements of strategic plans, including: mission, vision, values, goals, objectives, and stakeholders. Part 2 extends Part 1 to include the additional elements required for performance plans and reports, including stakeholder roles and performance indicators. Originally adopted as an American national standard (ANSI/AIIM 21:2009) Part 1, Strategic Plans, was published as an international standard (ISO 17469–1) on February 11, 2015, with minor changes from the ANSI version.[1] On November 13, 2015, the ANSI version of Part 1 was replaced with the ISO version (ANSI/AIIM/ISO 17469-1).[2] On January 9, 2017, the ISO changes and several additional enhancements were approved for incorporation into Part 2, Performance Plans and Reports (ANSI/AIIM 22).[3] Internationalization of Part 2 will depend upon sufficient support from other nations in the ISO process.

The vision of the StratML standard is: "A worldwide web of intentions, stakeholders, and results." Its more explicit purposes include enabling strategic alignment through literal linkages between performance objectives and the business records supporting them. Although the initial focus has been on the plans and reports that U.S. federal agencies are required to compile and maintain under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the standard has been specified generically so as to be applicable not only to all organizations, worldwide, but also to individuals who choose to lead mission/goal-directed lives. Section 10 of the [4] GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format. StratML is such a format.

Figure 29: Firefly Inspired Heartbeat Synchronization Algorithm
Firefly inspired heartbeat synchronization algorithm proposed by the Universities of Bologna Italy, Hungary includes message event bus algorithm – protocol, software application neutral monitors geo-spatial, temporally distributed events reported across a DAO among federated groups synchronized in time-space for common goals. The firefly algorithm (FA) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed by Xin-She Yang that is inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies (Yang, 2008), originally designed to solve continuous optimization problems (Lukasik and Żak, 2010; From: Swarm Intelligence and Bio-Inspired Computation, 2013. 
This work presents a heartbeat synchronization protocol for overlay networks inspired by mathematical models of flash synchronization in certain species of fireflies, and shows that synchronization emerges even when messages can have significant delay subject to large jitter. Heartbeat synchronization strives to have nodes in a distributed system generate periodic, local "heartbeat" events as heartbeat messages over a universal event message bus.

Figure 43: Proof of Work Consensus / USPTO 13/573,002
Proof of Work (PoW) was first published in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and was later applied by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin paper in 2008. The Proof of Work consensus algorithm involves solving a computational challenging puzzle in order to create new blocks in the blockchain. The process of verifying the transactions in the block to be added, organizing these transactions in a chronological order in the block and announcing the newly mined block to the entire network does not take much energy and time. The energy consuming part is solving the ‘hard mathematical problem’ to link the new block to the last block in the valid blockchain. When a miner finally finds the right solution, the node broadcasts it to the whole network at the same time, receiving a cryptocurrency prize (the reward) provided by the PoW protocol.

FIGURE 44: Proof of Stake Consensus
Proof-of-stake is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain. A consensus mechanism is a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the database secure. In the case of cryptocurrency, the database is called a blockchain—so the consensus mechanism secures the blockchain. The next block writer on the blockchain is selected at random, with higher odds being assigned to nodes with larger stake positions.

Figure 45: PoST Proof of Space – Time Consensus
The rational proof of financial interest in the network achieved by PoST addresses two problems with proof-of-capacity: Arbitrary amortized cost - In a consensus system that doesn't account for time, participants can generate an arbitrary amount of PoC proofs by reusing the same storage space, lowering their true cost.

Figure 46: Proof of Activity Consensus
Proof-of-activity (PoA) is a blockchain consensus algorithm is used to ensure that all transactions occurring on the blockchain are genuine, as well as to ensure that all miners arrive at a consensus. PoA is a combination of two other blockchain consensus algorithms: proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS). PoA increases the difficulty level of mining as time passes, PoA also prevents the chance of a 51% attack, like in POW and POS, because it is impossible to predict who the signing peer would be in the future, and coin saving competition among signers does not allow the computing power to be accumulated within a group.

Figure 47: Proof of Authority Consensus
Proof-Of-Authority (PoA) is a consensus method that gives a small and designated number of blockchain actors the power to validate transactions or interactions with the network and to update its more or less distributed registry. It works as follow: according to the chosen scheme, one or more validating machines are responsible for generating each new block of transactions that will be included in the Blockchain. The new block can be accepted directly without verification, or by unanimous vote of block generators, or simply by a majority, depending on the configuration chosen for the Blockchain.

Figure 48: Proof of Burn Consensus
PoB coins are “burned” by sending coins to an address from where they are irretrievable. By committing the coins to an unreachable address, validators earn a privilege to mine on the system based on a random selection process. Thus, burning coins means that validators have a long-term commitment in exchange for their short-term loss. Depending on how the PoB is implemented, miners may burn the native currency of the Blockchain application or the currency of an alternative chain, such as bitcoin. The more coins validators burn, the better the chances of being selected to mine the next block.

Figure 49: Proof of Capacity Consensus
Proof of capacity (PoC) is a consensus mechanism algorithm used in blockchains that allows for mining devices in the network to use their available hard drive space to decide mining rights and validate transactions. Proof of capacity (PoC) authentication systems employ spare space on a device's hard drive to store solutions to a cryptocurrency hashing problem. Proof of capacity allows the mining devices, also known as nodes, on the blockchain network to use empty space on their hard drive to mine the available cryptocurrencies. Instead of repeatedly altering the numbers in the block header and repeated hashing for the solution value as in a PoW system, PoC works by storing a list of possible solutions on the mining device’s hard drive even before the mining activity commences. The larger the hard drive, the more possible solution values one can store on the hard drive, the more chances a miner has to match the required hash value from his list, resulting in more chances to win the mining reward. To draw an analogy, if lottery rewards are based on matching the most numbers on the winning ticket, then a player with a longer list of possible solutions will have better chances of winning. Additionally, the player is allowed to keep using the lottery ticket block numbers again and again repeatedly.

Figure 50: Proof of Weight / Volumetric Consensus
Proof-of-Weight is a blockchain consensus mechanism that gives users a 'weight' based on how much cryptocurrency held. Proof-of-weight consensus mechanisms are based off of the first Proof-of-Weight consensus model used in the cryptocurrency Algorand, which was developed by researchers at the MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The Proof-of-Weight consensus mechanism remains secure as long as the majority of weighted users are honest, and protects the network against double-spend attacks. Each time a transaction is made on a blockchain using the Proof-of-Weight consensus mechanism, the network creates a committee of random network members and assigns each member 'weight' (based on how much currency held on the network) which slightly centralizes the consensus process within a random committee.

FIGURE 51: Bitcoin Classic / Core / Unlimited / USPTO 13/573,002
Bitcoin Classic was a proposed hard fork from Bitcoin Core that proposed increasing the maximum size of transaction blocks. Bitcoin Classic proposed increasing blockchain sizes from 1 megabyte to 2 megabytes. In effect, this would double the number of transactions that could be processed per second. The proposed increase was less aggressive than what was proposed by Bitcoin XT in 2015 proposed increasing the size of blocks to 8 megabytes.

FIGURE 52: Microsoft Cloud blockchain formerly known as Project BLETCHLEY 
Project Bletchley is a vision for Microsoft to deliver Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)
In Project Bletchley, Azure provides the fabric for blockchain, serving as the cloud platform where distributed applications are built and delivered. 
Azure will be open to a variety of blockchain protocols, supporting simple, Unspent Transaction Output-based protocols (UTXO) like Hyperledger, more sophisticated, Smart Contract-based protocols like Ethereum, and others as developed. Introduced in Project Bletchley are two new concepts: blockchain middleware and cryptlets. Blockchain middleware will provide core services functioning in the cloud, like identity and operations management, in addition to data and intelligence services like analytics and machine learning. These technologies will ensure the secure, immutable operation that blockchain provides, at the same time, deliver the business intelligence and reporting capabilities business leaders and regulators demand. Newly developed middleware will work in tandem with existing Azure services, like Active Directory and Key Vault, and other blockchain ecosystem technologies, to deliver a holistic platform and set of solutions. Cryptlets, a new building block of blockchain technology, will enable secure interoperation and communication between Microsoft Azure, ecosystem middleware and customer technologies. Cryptlets function when additional information is needed to execute a transaction or contract based on a date or time and providing market data. They will become a critical component of sophisticated blockchain systems, enabling all technology to work together in a secure, scalable way.

Figure 53: SAWTOOTH / POET Proof of Elapsed Time Consensus
Proof of elapsed time (PoET) is a blockchain network consensus mechanism that prevents high resource utilization and energy consumption; it keeps the process more efficient by following a fair lottery system. The algorithm uses a randomly generated elapsed time to decide mining rights and block winners on a blockchain network. By running a trusted code within a secure environment, the PoET algorithm also enhances transparency by ensuring lottery results are verifiable by external participants.
•	Proof of elapsed time (PoET) is a consensus algorithm developed by Intel Corporation that enables permissioned blockchain networks to determine who creates the next block.
•	PoET follows a lottery system that spreads chances of winning equally across network participants, giving each node the same chance.
•	The PoET algorithm generates a random wait time for each node in the blockchain network; each node must sleep for that duration.
•	The node with the shortest wait time will wake up first and win the block, thus being allowed to commit a new block to the blockchain.
•	PoET workflow is similar to Bitcoin's proof of work (PoW) but consumes less power because it allows a node to sleep and switch to other tasks for the specified time, thereby increasing network energy efficiency.

Figure 54: Proof of Space Time POST / USPTO 13/573,002
A proof of space-time ( PoST) shows the prover has spent an amount of time keeping the reserved space unchanged. Its creators reason that the cost of storage is inextricably linked not only to its capacity, but to the time in which that capacity is used.

Figure 55: State Channels / USPTO 13/573,002
State channels allow participants to securely transact off-chain while keeping interaction with Ethereum Mainnet at a minimum. Channel peers can conduct an arbitrary number of off-chain transactions while only submitting two on-chain transactions to open and close the channel. State channels are two-way pathways opened between two users that want to communicate with each other in the form of transactions. Each participant in the channel signs these transactions with his private key to ensure that they are undeniably true and authorized.

FIGURE 56: Segregated Witness - Lightning Consensus / USPTO 13/573,002
Segregated Witness (SegWit) refers to a change in the transaction format of Bitcoin. Its stated purpose as a protocol upgrade was to protect against transaction malleability and decrease transaction times by increasing block capacity. Transaction malleability refers to the possibility that tiny pieces of transaction information could be changed, invalidating new cryptocurrency blocks. It is intended to speed up the validation process by storing more transactions in a block.
Segregated Witness (SegWit) is a change in Bitcoin's transaction format where the witness information was removed from the input field of the block. The stated purpose of Segregated Witness is to prevent non-intentional Bitcoin transaction malleability and allow for more transactions to be stored within a block. SegWit is intended to solve a blockchain size limitation problem that reduces Bitcoin transaction speed.
The Lightning Network is a second layer for Bitcoin that uses micropayment channels to scale the blockchain’s capability to conduct transactions more efficiently. This layer consists of multiple payment channels between parties or Bitcoin users. A Lightning Network channel is a transaction mechanism between two parties. Using channels, the parties can make or receive payments from each other. Transactions conducted on the Lightning Network are faster, less costly, and more readily confirmed than those conducted directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network can also be used to conduct other types of off-chain transactions involving exchanges between cryptocurrencies. Concerns About the Lightning Network 
The most apparent problem with the Lightning Network—which is meant to be decentralized—is that it could lead to a replication of the hub-and-spoke model that characterizes today’s financial systems. In the current model, banks and financial institutions are the primary intermediaries through which all transactions occur. Businesses that invest in Lightning Network nodes may become similar hubs or centralized nodes in the network by having more open connections with others. Other concerns are fraud, fees, hacks, and price volatility.

We implement Bitcoin-NG and perform large-scale experiments at 15% the size of the operational Bitcoin system, using unchanged clients of both protocols. These experiments demonstrate that Bitcoin-NG scales optimally, with bandwidth limited only by the capacity of the individual nodes and latency limited only by the propagation time of the network.

As of 2018, coins were mined using a proof of work algorithm with a hash function called "X11", with eleven rounds of hashing, and the average time to mine a coin was around two and a half minutes. Masternodes provide two additional kinds of transactions. "InstantSend" bypasses mining and instead requires a consensus of masternodes to validate a transaction, speeding transactions.[3][1] "PrivateSend" is intended to give users optional consumer-grade privacy; it mixes participating users' unspent Dash before executing a transaction.

FIGURE 60: DASH / USPTO 13/573,002
Dash is an open source cryptocurrency. It is an altcoin that was forked from the Bitcoin protocol. It is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) run by a subset of its users called "masternodes".Dash was designed to allow transactions quickly and to have a swift governance structure in order to overcome shortfalls in Bitcoin.[3] What makes Dash different from Bitcoin is that it splits its rewards into three categories: 45% goes to miners, 45% goes to masternodes (these are computers that additional services in the network and have a significant investment in Dash tokens), and 10% goes towards its decentralized governance budget. Governance is handled through a form of decentralized autonomous organization in which decisions are made on a blockchain via masternodes. Masternodes perform standard node functions like hosting a copy of the blockchain, relaying messages, and validating transactions on the network, and in addition act as shareholders, voting on proposals for improving Dash's ecosystem. Anyone with 1,000 Dash Coins (DASH), the protocols native cryptocurrency, can become a masternode owner.

Byzantine Fault-Tolerant State Machine Replication BFT-SMART dynamic distributed system processes are divided in two nonintersecting subsets: replicas and clients. Each system process has a unique identifier. During dynamic system execution, a sequence of views is installed to denote the reconfigurations due to replicas joins and leaves. A view is composed by a set of replicas identifiers. Modularity is achieved using a set of building blocks(or modules)containing the core functionality of BFTSMART. Blocks are divided in three groups: communication system, state machine replication and state management. BFT-SMART needs an eventually synchronous system. Total order multicast is achieved using the Mod-SMaRt protocol and with the Byzantine consensus algorithm Clients send requests to all replicas in cv, and wait for replies. replicas store each batch of ordered requests to a (stable) log and, periodically, take snapshots of the application state and store it in stable memory.

Figure 68: HASHGRAPH DAG Directed Acyclic Graph / USPTO 13/573,002
Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is a type of smart contract used in blockchain applications. It reduces counterparty risk by creating a time-based escrow that requires a cryptographic passphrase for unlocking. In practical terms, this means that the person receiving the funds in a transaction has to perform two actions to access the funds: enter the correct passphrase and claim payment within a specific timeframe. If they enter an incorrect passphrase or do not claim the funds within the timeframe, they lose access to the payment. A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) reduces counterparty risk in decentralized smart contracts by effectively creating a time-based escrow that utilizes a cryptographic passphrase. This type of smart contract requires the receiver of a payment to acknowledge it within a certain period of time or forfeit it. HTLCs is a fundamental tool used by the lightning network.

Blocktime Arbitrage MTL (machine trust language) time primitives might be assigned to a micropayment channel DAPP as a time arbiter. In blocktime, the time interval at which things are done is by block. This is the time that it takes blocks to confirm, so blockchain system processes like those involving smart contracts are ordered around the conception of blocktime quanta or units. Since blocktime is an inherent blockchain feature, one of the easiest ways to programmatically specify future time intervals for event conditions and state changes in blockchain-based events is via BLOCKTIME. Universal blocktime source example: a procedure call to NIST or other time oracle.

BLOCKTIME: A General Temporality of Blockchains Blocktime as blockchains’ temporality allows the possibility of rejiggering time and making it a malleable property of blockchains. The in-built time clock in blockchains is blocktime, the chain of time by which a certain number of blocks will have been confirmed. Time is specified in units of transaction block confirmation times, not minutes or hours like in a human time system. Block confirmation times are convertible to minutes. Conversion metrics may change over time. Credit: Melanie Swan: Blockchain Blueprint for a new economy

E-GaaS: international blockchain platform for organizing economic, state, social activities of citizens , communities on the basis of smart law, smart contract system. eGaaS offers a comprehensive solution needed for state and business management on the blockchain platform. Distributed digital asset registries were the first projects that used blockchain systems such as databases designed for secure storage of records on real estate property, stocks, copyright and so on. It is assumed  hosting any document on the blockchain is equivalent to notarization of its content at a fixed time point ex: 
7.2 A continuous action, operation, series of changes, sync deltas updating groups
1.5.7.3 A cyclic, iterative process syncing groups in time-space
Sync Deltas = changes from one epoch time cycle to the next: crypto currencies tethered to tangible commodities formed into indices of assets.
Heart Beacon Cycle provides a signal and telemetry framework reporting events, transactions to facilitate reporting of data sync deltas in time window intervals, stages and uses data filtering iteration to eliminate duplicated instructions, identical source code in the system of systems signaling, systems telemetry engineering framework.

Figure 86: GNOSIS / USPTO 13/573,002
Gnosis Wisdom (WIZ) pay platform fees in Services layer, Wiz subsidize other participants fees, provide initial subsidies for markets, or market trading. WIZ pegged to $1 USD worth of fees. WIZ acts as coupon for $1 of Gnosis
Gnosis tokens (GNO) generate Wisdom token s(WIZ) via smart contract
GNO token holders agree to “lock” tokens in a smart contract (30-365 days). A multiplier is added for longer lock durations. Smart contract determines selected lock duration and applies that duration to a formula regulating supply of WIZ tokens currently in use. Once users execute the contract, 30% of their WIZ are distributed for use, the remaining 70% is distributed proportionally over the locked duration. When lock duration expires, the locked GNO ceases to generate WIZ & GNO is freely transferable

The crypto community has six major issues: Volatility, Inconsistent Memes, Identity, lack of intrinsic value and blockchain scalability. USPTO 13/573,002 addresses all six issues systemically. All things internet are built / made of TIME Cycles used / not used to process syntax as instructions. It follows, that issues with any internet system -- including Bitcoin must be fixed using this fundamental, universal truth.

IDENTITY: Organizational unit (computing) From Wikipedia, In computing, an organizational unit (OU) provides a way of classifying objects located in directories, or names in a digital certificate hierarchy, typically used either to differentiate between objects with the same name (John Doe in OU "marketing" versus John Doe in OU "customer service"), or to parcel out authority to create and manage objects (for example: to give rights for user-creation to local technicians instead of having to manage all accounts from a single central group). Organizational units most commonly appear in X.500 directories, X.509 certificates, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories, active directory (AD), and directories and certificate trees, but they may feature in almost any modern directory or digital certificate container grouping system. In most systems, organizational units appear within a top-level organization grouping or organization certificate, called a domain. In many systems one OU can also exist within another OU. When OUs are nested, as one OU contains another OU, this creates a relationship where the contained OU is called the child and the container is called the parent. Thus, OUs are used to create a hierarchy of containers within a domain. Only OUs within the same domain can have relationships. OUs of the same name in different domains are independent.

Figure 90: Double Slit experiment particle / wave duality
In physics, the double-slit experiment is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles; ... experiment with light was part of classical physics long before the development of quantum mechanics and the concept of wave-particle duality. Quantum computing based on waves at room temperature Vs particles in a liquid nitrogen cooled chamber given energy required to keep the environment near absolute zero with liquid nitrogen. Use of light waves at room temperature = more ecologically sustainable, more accurate quantum computing given less challenge to synchronize, stochastically harmonize quantum computing sites over UTZ Universal Time Zone as a basis for programming, computing programmable money / programmable economy.

Figure 91: USPTO 13/573,002 Quantum Computing Space – Time
Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank are your patent applications, patents grants descriptive to the quantum computing level - future proofed? Are they written to be quantum resistant, or quantum based or both? What if events could be propagated by waves - is there a need for liquid nitrogen if the method and means is light wave laser based? Why go the liquid nitrogen route if we know the challenges in maintaining consistent temperatures across the globe at sea level Vs mountain tops, equator Vs poles... and don't forget the need to stochastically harmonize data sampling fluctuations across the world's time zones...

Figure 92: QUANTUM COMPUTING / USPTO 13/573,002 SYNERGY
A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware.

Figure 94: NIST QRNB Quantum Random Number Beacon 

NIST has developed a method for generating numbers guaranteed to be random by quantum mechanics. The method generates digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons, or particles of light. An intense laser hits a special crystal that converts laser light into pairs of photons that are entangled, a quantum phenomenon that links their properties. generates full-entropy bit-strings and posts them in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds. Each such value is sequence-numbered, time-stamped and signed, and includes the hash of the previous value to chain the sequence of values together and prevent even the source to retroactively change an output package without being detected.

Figure 95: Hopf Fibration / Bloch sphere

Hopf fibration, Hopf bundle or Hopf map describes a 3-sphere (a hypersphere in four-dimensional space) in terms of circles and an ordinary sphere. Discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931, it is an influential early example of a fiber bundle. “The most important object in the universe”. “Hopf fiber bundles appear in 8 quantum physis situtions.”

In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system ( qubit ), named after the physicist Felix Bloch. [1] Quantum mechanics is mathematically formulated in Hilbert space or projective Hilbert space. the points on the surface of the Bloch sphere represent the pure states of a single 2-level quantum system. A pure state being of the form: |ψ⟩=a|0⟩+b|1⟩ and typically the north and south poles of this sphere correspond to the |0⟩ and |1⟩states. The qubit |psi>=a|0>+b|1> can be represented as a point (theta,phi) on a unit sphere called the Bloch sphere. Define the angles theta and phi by letting a=cos(theta/2) and b=e^(iphi)sin(theta/2). Here, a is taken to be real, which can always be made real by multiplying |psi> by an overall phase factor (that is unobservable). Then |psi> is represented by the unit vector (cosphisintheta, sinphisintheta, costheta) called the Bloch vector.

QUANTUM COMPUTING: the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization. in a quantum Turing machine, the difference is that the tape exists in a quantum state, as does the read-write head. This means that the symbols on the tape can be either 0 or 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1; in other words, the symbols are both 0 and 1 (and all points in between) at the same time. While a normal Turing machine can only perform one calculation at a time, a quantum Turing machine can perform many calculations at once. The programmable economy will be anchored by quantum computing -for example, NIST's Quantum Random Number Beacon

Figure 97: The Great Reset of 2021 / Greater Reset of 2021 – 2030 – 2050 ?
“The Great Reset agenda would have three main components. The first would steer the market toward fairer outcomes. To this end, governments should improve coordination (for example, in tax, regulatory, and fiscal policy), upgrade trade arrangements, and create the conditions for a "stakeholder economy." To achieve a better outcome, the world must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions. Every country, from the United States to China, must participate, and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed. In short, we need a “Great Reset” of capitalism”

FIGURE 98: Solar Nova + Pole shift Vs Crypto chips

The 1859 Carrington Event impacted telegraph wires. Is it time to relook at the world's monetary unit of value in light of a energy grid / internet that is disabled? The Carrington Event was the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history, peaking from 1 to 2 September 1859 during solar cycle 10. It created strong auroral displays that were reported globally [1] and caused sparking and even fires in multiple telegraph stations. The geomagnetic storm was most likely the result of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun colliding with Earth's magnetosphere. In context with the world’s monetary unit, should we consider silicon chips vulnerability given electromagnetic pulse EMP?

Blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast and workflow filters. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Internet 3.0 and the new web will be based on the original structure described by Stanford University. There are no packets, frames, layers, blocks, shards, graphs, hash graphs “bots”, “motes”, … or Satoshi's traversing the net, stored in a blockchain cube. Transactions are unicast, multicast, or anycast (workflow). The afore mention terms are non-existent fabrication. Method includes for example, universal meme for Bitcoin and like cryptocurrencies, Blockchain Proof of Work, Stake, POET Proof of Elapsed Time, Project Lightning Vs Segregated Witness, and Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine FIBRE...
