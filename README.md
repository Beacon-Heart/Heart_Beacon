Eco Economic Epochs: It's about TIME  Ecosystem incentives coded into the programmable Economy

THESIS: All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:
1.	Time epochs created by oscillating quartz crystal based silicon chips
2.	Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles

Time epochs / syntax: two main building blocks in creating the Artificial Intelligence A.I. powered global economic system of systems / Earth Intelligence Network EIN / Web 3.0 and the programmable economy in terms of temporal consistency, interoperability, and consensus.

PROPOSAL: Code Eco sustainable incentives into programmable economic system of systems engineering framework reusing / leveraging NATO systems of systems engineering best practice.

1.Reuse OPSCODE brevity codes mapped to message symbol sets enabling Artificial Intelligence / human interaction ( i.e., man — machine interface).

2. Apply lessons learned (bandwidth discipline, interoperability, OPTEMPO sync cycles... intrinsic to NATO SOP swords to plowshares following German military proposal use cases circa 2003.

NATO has invested 30 years of mapping OPSCODE brevity codes to symbology / symbols / symbol sets contained in 300 plus message set / use cases as part of Battlefield digitization, Net Centric Warfare NET Enabled Operations NEO NETOPS. Blockchain, crypto currency developers are recreating, reinventing  this decades old, tedious, time intensive, labor intensive, expensive wheel.

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time  - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an adaptive procedural template / checklist of ideas, methods, processes, procedures, algorithms, tools… used to organize diverse peoples speaking many different languages through the universal language of symbols into Distributed Autonomous groups organized in time - space to achieve common goals such as establishing an Ecologically sustainable Economic heartbeat. 

PROJECT BEACON: Reuse NATO's system of systems syntax lexicon OPSCODE brevity code structured data exchange, heartbeat micro to macro cycle Universal Time Zone UTZ sync to support an EIN Earth Intelligence Network neural net emulation. We have a clear and present opportunity and responsibility to improve temporal, geo-spatial, syntactic - semantic consistency, interoperability among myriad programmable money memes among a federated, distributed system of systems.

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a distributed system of systems engineering signaling -telemetry temporal, geo-spatial, semantic - syntactic sync and consensus foundation framework. A an adaptive procedural template checklist of tools, algorithms, cryptographic modules, it supports DAAE Distributed Autonomous Automated Economy Eco - Economic Heartbeat.

The Heart Beacon Cycle is an adaptive procedural template checklist of things, processes, tools, building blocks useful to form, maintain Eco-responsible trade federations. Each item in the procedural template checklist links to a detailed treatise. We can synchronize ourselves, our cities, towns, cyber-communities in time — space for a common purpose: shared, common, ecologically sound, responsible econometrics. 

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a swords to plowshares DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization project using NATO’s Situational Awareness system of systems engineering framework, processes, procedures and internet building blocks to establish an Ecologically sustainable Economic Heartbeat, neural network emulation for the EIN Earth Intelligence Network and heartbeat sync pulse for a Universal Time Zone UTZ supporting a one world currency. It’s syntax lexicon library of OPSCODE brevity codes used in programmable money, the programmable economy is descriptive of all things internet, internet of money down to the quantum computing, quantum blockchain level.

This course of action in challenging times  involves reuse of over 300 NATO cases supported by hundreds of message sets further described in spread sheet row - column format populated by thousands of brevity OPSCODES mapped to symbols essential to artificial intelligence man - machine interface. NATO bases are small cities that transact virtually every good, item, commodity with it's host nation. Why reinvent the syntax lexicon Rosetta Stone wheel? Think of this as a system of systems tool to accelerate an EIN Earth Intelligence Net – see Project #UNRIG for mor information.

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a signaling, telemetry distributed systems engineering framework improving temporal, geo-spatial, semantic - syntactic sync & consensus among DAAE Distributed Autonomous Automated Economy system of systems reusing Battlefield Digitization, Net Enabled Operations engineering swords to plowshares.

Eco sustainable incentives integral to an Economic system of systems SoS engineering framework used by NATO for decades. Digital Nations need an (Eco sustainable) Economic Heartbeat & a consistent syntax lexicon library.

Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN see Robert David Steele’s #UNRIG proposal @ http://robertdavidsteele.com

Economic #RESET is a mathematical certainty. Do we RESET the global system of systems as is or will we re-engineer using NATO system of systems engineering framework standing on the shoulders of giants to convert swords to plowshares?

IF / WHEN: Climate Change causes a drop in crop commodity food production by 20–25 % while population continues to grow, THEN it follows that this condition will become a matter of national security. It’s TIME to implement an Ecologically Sustainable Economic Heartbeat ELSE face > greater chaos by not leveraging proven system of system structured data exchange methods. An ecologically sustainable economic heartbeat is needed. Why wait until crisis, DEFCON 2 stage?

If / when climate change causes a drop in crop commodity by 20–25 % while population grows, THEN this condition will become a matter of national security. THEN this will require revisiting Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer’s TRC Trade Reference Currency ELSE face >socio economic chaos LINK http://lietaer.com/2010/01/terra/  

Ecologically sustainable economic transactions need to be incentivized among the world’s Ecological and Economic system of systems. The world’s systems need to be time-space synchronized, stochastically harmonized across the one world, global UTZ Universal Time Zone via heartbeat messages using universally shared, standards based OPSCODE brevity codes drawn from a universal structured data exchange syntax lexicon with over 300 use case templates e.g., NATO’s lexicon library

System of Systems Engineering Framework: Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN. It is time to build a new economic system of systems framework. 

All things internet, net of money blockchain cryptocurrencies are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. The term DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization was coined by the RAND Corporation circa 2000. 

Nobel Prize winning Economist Milton Friedman’s K% rule is an “economic heartbeat”. K-Percent Rule DEFINITION: The K-Percent Rule proposal by economist Milton Friedman was the central bank should increase the money supply by a constant percentage every year. The K-Percent Rule proposes to set the money supply growth / reduction at a rate equal to the growth of real GDP each year. K-Percent Rule — Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/k-percent-rule.asp

HEARTBEAT SCOP Administrative Interface as an Internet, net of Money configuration tool. SCOP is a tool that exemplifies how the internet really works. There are no levels, layers, packets, frames, bits, ether gas, hashgraphs, bytes motes, block chain blocks, pings, packets... There are only 1) epoch time intervals, 2) syntax used as if, then, else instructions. Time epoch time cycles used / not used to parse, process syntax as instructions are the only building blocks available to scale the blockchain. Blockchain scaling usually involves a discussion of “layers” when the reality is that parsing, processing syntax (OPSCODE brevity codes, shards, hashes) is passed from the genesis Epoch Time Cycle 1 to a temporal follow on epoch time cycle often involving geo-spatial, temporal separation.

Project Task: form federations of Distributed, Autonomous Organizations DAO communities, states, sovereign nations using an adaptive procedural template checklist promoting synchronization among geo-spatially and temporally dispersed groups. Federated groups activities are synchronized geo-spatially across time - space to achieve synergy, synchronicity of events orchestrated from micro to macro cycles from grassroots to capitals.
