TITLE: Adaptive Procedural Template: Use Case: GDP index based currency for the programmable economy

DESCRIPTION: Eco Economic Epochs for DATF Distributed Autonomous Trade Federations / DAOs, programmable $$$, Economy using a Adaptive Procedural Template derived from Battlefield Digitization, Net Centric Warfare, System of Systems Engineering framework
 
GOAL: We can synchronize ourselves in time-space for common goals: signaling telemetry system of systems framework supporting an equitable, sustainable, programmable money backed by tangible commodities / programmable economy 

PROJECT PURPOSE: Describe an Eco Economic Epoch Heartbeat for programmable $$$ / Economy using a Adaptive Procedural Template derived from Battlefield Digitization, Net Centric Warfare, System of Systems Engineering best practice for OOTW Operations Other Than War - a German Army suggestion made in 2003 to support DATF Distributed Autonomous Trade Federations / DAOs for a world economic framework 

This project  describes how the internet and derivatively the internet of money works and is compliant with the Supreme Court's Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank 2014 ruling "claims may not direct towards abstract ideas".  All internet Web 3.0 and programmable money efforts are incorrect and are moving away from interoperability as each internet, internet of money theme variation sprouts and propagates more and more made up memes, metaphors that do not in actuality exist.  The world is moving away from a consistent, coherent signaling, telemetry support framework to support a one world  government, economic system of systems described by The World Economic Forum WEF. 

PROJECT PURPOSE / PRECEDENT: Describe a  syntax lexicon Rosetta Stone library derived from Pentagon / NATO system of systems engineering best practice since the mid 1990's. The German Army suggested that Pentagon / NATO system of systems engineering best practice used among NATO's digital dashboard software be reused for OOTW Operations Other Than War. The German Army made it's OOTW suggestion circa 2003. This project describes DoD / NATO system of systems engineering fundamentals and makes suggestions to improve on DoD / NATO efforts in continuous development since the mid 1990's current to quantum computing techniques. 

Minimum essential requirements for Trade Federations on the cryptocurrency DLT Distributed Ledger Technology blockchain (partial listing):

PATENT APPLICATION TYPE: Adaptive Procedural Template USPTO 13/573,002: Time-Space Meter / Syntax Lexicon Rosetta Stone, Checklist: adaptive procedural template in patent application terms does not capture attention so graphics are used as a picture representing a checklist of useful tools, procedures, processes, algorithms, ideas that a trade federation would agree to use to achieve, maintain their collective goals of the distributed federation. 
The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space Meter Adaptive Procedural Template checklist of useful tools, procedures, products, algorithms, econometrics, processes, metrics, meters, e.g., time - space, geo-spatial, temporal, cryptocurrency data storage into a "blockchain cube" with height, width, depth, volume, programmable money metrics, meters representing, describing a myriad of memes, metaphors within the cryptocurrency programmable money continuum.

PATENT APPLICATION USPTO 13/573,002 The Heart Beacon Cycle Time  - Space Meter is an adaptive procedural template / checklist of ideas, methods, processes, procedures, algorithms, tools… used to organize diverse peoples speaking many different languages through the universal language of symbols into Distributed Autonomous groups organized in time - space to achieve common goals among individuals organized into federated groups in DAO (s) Distributed Autonomous Organizations - a RAND Corporation term (DoD funded Think Tank) circa 2001. Each item in the procedural template checklist links to detailed treatise that includes expansive description

USPTO 13/573,002 METHOD: Code Eco sustainable incentives into programmable economic framework reusing / leveraging NATO systems of systems engineering best practice. Form federations of Distributed, Autonomous Organizations DAO communities, states, sovereign nations using an adaptive procedural template checklist promoting organization and synchronization among geo-spatially and temporally dispersed groups using a common syntax – symbol set lexicon.

1.	Reuse OPSCODE brevity codes mapped to message symbol sets enabling Artificial Intelligence / human interaction ( i.e., man — machine interface).

2.	Apply lessons learned (bandwidth discipline, interoperability, OPTEMPO sync cycles... intrinsic to NATO SOP swords to plowshares following German military proposal use cases circa 2003.

THESIS: All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:

1.	Time epochs created by oscillating quartz crystal based silicon chips

2.	Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles

All things internet, net of money blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast protocols. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast and workflow filters. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Internet 3.0 and the new web will be based on the original structure described by Stanford University. There are no packets, frames, layers, blocks, shards, graphs, hash graphs “bots”, “motes”, … or Satoshi's traversing the net, stored in a blockchain cube. Transactions are unicast, multicast, or anycast (workflow).

The above cited memes made up terms are non - compliant US Supreme Court SCOTUS Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank 2014 ruling “claims may not direct towards abstract ideas”, Note: Physical is the opposite of abstract considering SCOTUS Alice 2014 ruling and in light of the fact that NIST’s National Institute of Standards and Technology QRNB Quantum Random Number Beacon is based on light photonics.

THREE OPTIONS: one world government’s one world currency:

PRECEDENT: Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman's K% rule is a GDP Gross Domestic Product economic heartbeat, a GDP pulse. Apply a Quantum Random Number Beacon QRNB for non-repudiation at any location / time in the future = basis for a one world economic system of systems unit of value FEDCOIN, World Coin
PRECEDENT: GDP INDEX ECONOMY: Thomas Edison and Henry Ford proposed a currency based on a basket of crop commodities. Edison believed that crops held their value over time - enter climate change reality and the merits are self-evident.

PRECEDENT TRADE REFERENCE CURRENCY TRC / FRENCH MONEY OF PEACE: Later in the 1990's, Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer proposed a commodity based TRC Trade Reference Currency based on demurrage charges to support logistics of goods moved from supplier to consumer called the TERRA TRC. Prior to his passing, Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman described an "economic heartbeat" in his K% rule where the Treasury increases the money supply increases and decreases pegged to the GDP index. Nations / the world's economy would be managed as a composite value index like for example, Vanguard's index funds, commodity index funds.

PRECEDENT: NOBLE PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST: Milton Friedman’s K% rule as an “economic heartbeat”. K-Percent Rule DEFINITION: The K-Percent Rule proposal by economist Milton Friedman was the central bank should increase the money supply by a constant percentage every year. The K-Percent Rule proposes to set the money supply growth / reduction at a rate equal to the growth of real GDP each year. K-Percent Rule — Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/k-percent-rule.asp

PRECEDENT: NOBEL PRIZE WINNER Simon Smith Kuznets gross national income (GNI), previously known as gross national product (GNP), is the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country, consisting of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), plus factor incomes earned by foreign residents, minus income earned in the domestic economy by nonresidents (Todaro & Smith, 2011: 44).[2] Comparing GNI to GDP shows the degree to which a nation's GDP represents domestic or international activity. GNI has gradually replaced GNP in international statistics. Kuznets became the first economist to show that the Absolute Income Hypothesis gives inaccurate predictions in the long run by using time-series data.

PRECEDENT: WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM WEF ENHANCED GDP: the World Economic Forum has proposed a scorecard made up of four dimensions that need to be brought into balance: prosperity, the planet, people and the role of institutions.

Prosperity vs economic growth. The World Economic Forum’s ‘Prosperity’ metric includes aspects such as social mobility, income or wealth inequality and financial resilience. Gross Domestic Product GDP index falued currency units features within the Prosperity dimension updated to reflect different dynamics within the world economy.

PROJECT BEACON: Reuse NATO's system of systems syntax lexicon OPSCODE brevity code structured data exchange, heartbeat micro to macro cycle Universal Time Zone UTZ sync to support an EIN Earth Intelligence Network neural net emulation. Support Beacon Communities with an open-source Earth Intelligence Network EIN integrated with a quantum random number beacon blockchain for event, transaction non-repudiation at any place – time in the future . METHOD: A snapshot or sync delta value taken at a predetermined time interval (micro-cycle to macro cycle) to determine the statistical mean value of the goods, commodities that comprise a GDP index is performed and used as the value of the organization's / nation's / world's unit of value as the basis for currency exchange. This process reuses DARPA / NATO's Battlefield Digitization, Net Enabled Operations NEO procedures that have supported the Pentagon's / NATO's digital dashboards since the 1990's. 

ECO INCENTIVES: Ecologically sustainable economic transactions need to be incentivized among the world’s Ecological and Economic system of systems. The world’s systems need to be time-space synchronized, stochastically harmonized across the one world, global UTZ Universal Time Zone via heartbeat messages using universally shared, standards based OPSCODE brevity codes drawn from a universal structured data exchange syntax lexicon with over 300 use case templates e.g., NATO’s lexicon library

NATO SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING REUSE: NATO has invested decades of mapping OPSCODE brevity codes to symbology / symbols / symbol sets contained in three hundred 300 plus message set / use cases as part of Battlefield digitization, Net Centric Warfare NET Enabled Operations NEO NETOPS system of systems engineering. Blockchain, crypto currency developers are recreating, reinventing this decades old, tedious, time intensive, labor intensive, expensive structured data exchange wheel with every new meme, metaphor.
Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone using the firefly-heartbeat algorithm and Princeton University Mathematician John Nash’s Equilibrium algorithms NATO bases are small cities that transact most goods, commodities with the host nation. Why reinvent the syntax lexicon Rosetta Stone wheel? This is a system of systems tool to accelerate an EIN Earth Intelligence Net – see Project #UNRIG by Robert David Steele

REUSE 1: A systemic, adaptive, procedural template method used to improve synchronization in metrics, metering using </Org_ID>, {“URN”} XML data tags in signaling during heartbeat micro-cycles prior to data fusion center entry consisting of iterative heartbeat cycle metrics, meters reporting where state meta data heartbeat snapshot recalculations are performed at off site connectors that are signaling relays performing recalculation, syntax processing during macro-cycle epochs reconciling dissimilar standards, data syntax formats that are then reported signaled, news casted, beacon broadcasted to distributed organization applique overlay displays

REUSE 2.  A adaptive procedural template used to improve signaling, synchronization using TCP/IP heartbeat time stamping occurring during micro-cycles of state meta data prior to data fusion center entry among metrics, metering processes comprised of TCP/IP heartbeats, heartbeat messages signaled during micro-cycles scheduling instructions, commands, processes, procedures, algorithms, telemetry instructions for example, to master-controller processes i.e., block, start, stop, pause, resume, set Time To live TTL i.e., stock market high frequency flash trade, currency, interest rates, tax rates, time banking, cloud computing commodity exchanges, big data, electrical micro-grid, fungible goods, real time bidding, many use cases. Summary: Time stamping and applying descriptive data type tags to heartbeat state meta data after data is collected and queued, stored in temporary structures or entered into data base instantiations after the fact is problematic. All internet supported devices including high frequency stock, currency, commodity etc., flash trade master controllers receive heartbeats. Heartbeats are silicon chip created intervals, epochs, time cycles used to (not) process syntax.

REUSE 3. A systemic adaptive procedural template method  improving stochastic networks harmonization through use of timing, synchronization intrinsic to TCP/IP heartbeat / heartbeat message signaling using set, scheduled, epochs in micro-cycles in  combination with firefly insect signaling stochastic harmonization algorithms where firefly protocol sample means are matched with closest heartbeat sync delta micro-cycle report values to recalculate statistical averages, means signaled through off site connector conversion, recalculation gateways that news-cast, beacon broadcast to subscribers monitoring macro-cycle reports that heretofore would not exist without following the Heart Beacon Cycle procedural template as guides for reporting thus improving temporal harmonization in metrics and metering of stochastic telecommunication mesh fabrics grid control planes over wide areas in cases involving issues in terms of consistency, reliability, traceability, positive organizational identification, temporal transaction fidelity, event, alert predictability, data analytics, network forensics real rime bidding, stock market exchange floor server co-location verses servers distantly located, fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchanges, double payment adjudication, fungible good trading stochastic harmonization, electrical power micro-grids, cloud computing, "big data"...

REUSE 4.

A systemic adaptive procedural template method improving search engine methods using heartbeat, beacon signaling, <ORG_ID>, <URN>, <class_types>, Paul Revere, water drop in pond meme metric recalculations occurring at off site connectors, conversion relay gateways where detection of trigger point function recalculations of state meta data set aggregations are used to detect threshold fluctuations by resource <class>, <type>, quantity, availability duration etc., further used to improve geo-spatial temporal descriptive mapping methods, changes in clusters of objects, entities, artifacts i.e., location, epoch time stamp geo-spatially, temporally, used to locate, search, then group into virtual collections using <data_tags> i.e., <rare> in spatial econometric, volumetric operations within network mesh fabrics triggering news-casting invitations to join equitably metered federated group arbitrage events, activities that are triggered by internet search operations improving collaboration, metrics and metering in for example, commodity, fungibles trading, resource pooling, crowd sourcing, economics.Summary: Physical linear – sequential “Paul Revere” meme used given TCP/IP internet “hops” are abstractions ineligible for patent protect. Water drop in pond physical metaphor describes geospatial temporal intensity in omni-directional, circle, radius type situations. Naval sonar meme explains geo-spatial temporal intensity metrics, meters. TCP/IP “ping” is an abstraction.

REUSE 6. A systemic adaptive procedural template method used to improve handicapped / information alerts, events, methods reliant on heartbeat timing, signaling synchronization of state meta-data improved using Paul Revere, water drop in pond memes to create, calculate radius, intensity metrics viewed as geo-spatial, temporal intensity effects i.e., visual light bar tabs i.e., stock exchange candlestick charts, audible tone, vibration-tactile situational awareness alerts by correlating tone based messaging precedence XML <tag> where lower / higher precedence settings equate to lower / higher audible tones, tactile vibrations for deaf where fewer / greater number of light tabs lit correlates, corresponds to priority, precedence <tags> further used in alert triggers of threshold fluctuations displayed in appliqué overlay graphics as metrics, meters.
Reference: Describes reuse of structured military messaging’s precedence system to support for example, processing of Named Data Networking distance, interest packets by numeric precedence. This method is effective among machine to machine (Internet of Things).  

REUSE 7. A systemic, adaptive procedural template method using heartbeat signaling, time stamp record keeping processes of state meta data described, typed by organizations, resources typed by Uniform Resource Name, further improved through use of Paul Revere, Water Drop in Pond memes to quantify, describe unused resources with unmet needs by performing recalculations of state meta-data snapshot artifacts occurring at off site connector conversion gateways where 
micro-cycle reports from local, micro-cycle activities are signaled, relayed to higher echelon organizations monitoring macro-cycles who are interested in for example stock market "pools” where "output" is correlated and displayed onto appliqué views of aggregate sync delta changes in macro-micro economics recalculations, stocks, commodities, currencies, interest rates, electric micro-grids, currency (Terra) exchanges, spatial econometrics, contributory economics. Syntax code language parsed, processed during silicon chip generated time cycles forms all things internet, internet of money. Claim describes the military’s network centric operations systems of systems method of collecting state meta data sync delta heartbeat snapshot data during operational micro-cycles that is then summed, aggregated, disseminated and displayed during macro-cycles as part of Network Enabled Operations NEO situation awareness system of systems engineering. USPTO vetted application for National security.

QUANTUM COMPUTING: the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization. in a quantum Turing machine, the difference is that the tape exists in a quantum state, as does the read-write head. This means that the symbols on the tape can be either 0 or 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1; in other words the symbols are both 0 and 1 (and all points in between) at the same time. While a normal Turing machine can only perform one calculation at a time, a quantum Turing machine can perform many calculations at once. The programmable economy will be anchored by quantum computing -for example, NIST's Quantum Random Number Beacon

1. Quantum Random Number Generator: The NIST method generates digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons, or particles of light, using data generated in an improved version of a landmark 2015 NIST physics experiment. That experiment showed conclusively that what Einstein described as "spooky action at a distance" is real. Researchers process the spooky output to certify and quantify the randomness available in the data and generate a string of more random bits.

2. The NIST Randomness Beacon Broadcasts a randomness pulse every 60 seconds Each pulse commits to a fresh 512-bit random string Each pulse is time-stamped and signed. Beacon periodically outputs a pulse containing 512 fresh random bits, time-stamped, signed and hash-chained. For example, each pulse also pre-commits to the randomness to be released in the next pulse. The latter enables users to securely combine randomness from different beacons. The Beacon protocol also specifies the interface for users to interact with the Beacon, in order to obtain information about past pulses. A randomness beacon produces timed outputs of fresh public randomness. Each output, called a pulse, includes metadata / cryptographic elements. The main goal of the NIST Random # Beacon is to serve as a baseline for deployment of many interoperable beacons NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/The-NIST-Randomness-Beacon-2-0/images-media/SciDay18-poster-beacon-v20181022.pdf

IEEE Article: Quantum Computing Error Correct QEC is getting practical February 25th 2021: Quantum Error Correction QEC, in combination with the theory of fault-tolerant quantum computing, suggests that engineers can in principle build an arbitrarily large quantum computer that if operated correctly would be capable of arbitrarily long computations. This would be a stunningly powerful achievement. The prospect that it can be realized underpins the entire field of quantum computer science: Replace all quantum computing hardware with “logical” qubits running QEC, and even the most complex algorithms come into reach. For instance, Shor’s algorithm could be deployed to render Bitcoin insecure with just a few thousand error-corrected logical qubits.

PRECEDENT: United States Patent Application: 0160358256[0056 In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, the amount of an investment required from a speculator is calculated by executing the following cost of speculation equation: V.intg.|log(P)-log(.DELTA.P)|/R dt. The variables for the cost of speculation equation are as follows: P represents a variable of price, P(t) is a variable function of price over time in a given market, .DELTA.P represent a speculative price function. P(t) can mathematically represent the future prices as functions of price over time. The function value of R(t) is a predetermined value for the rate of return. For example, for R(t), the value can be 100% annualized so for a t in years R(1)=2, R(2)=4 and R(0.5)=1.414, but as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, any function is possible. The value for V(t) at any given time is the expected value to the market (e.g., volume of goods to trade multiplied by the market commission) The value for V(t) can be updated empirically as the commodities market functions by calculation as a moving average of volume times the markets total transactional overhead charge.

Secrets of Synchronization / Particle - wave duality (#quantum) firefly pair coupling to synchronize across time - space via firefly-heartbeat algorithm for stochastic harmonization, UTZ synchronization @ 8:10: https://youtu.be/t-_VPRCtiUg?t=490
 
A time crystal, first proposed by physicist Frank Wilczek in 2012, is a phase of matter which repeats in time, similar to how a regular crystal's structure repeats in space. What that means is that the particles in the crystal perpetually switch between two states without requiring the input of more energy and without losing any energy. These crystals are the first objects to break what is known as "time-translation symmetry," a rule in physics that states that a stable object will remain unchanged throughout time. Time crystals avoid this rule, being both stable and ever-changing. Scientists from Stanford and the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems, as well as scientists at QuTech, a collaboration between the Delft University of Technology and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), figured out for the first time how to create these theoretical crystals.

The 13 Moon calendar is a solar-galactic cycle that meshes the 365-day third-dimensional solar cycle with the 260-day fourth-dimensional galactic cycle (Tzolkin) every 52 years. The 365-day orbit of Earth around the Sun naturally divides into thirteen 28-day sequences (13×28=364) which correspond to the thirteen lunations occurring during one solar year, plus one extra day, July 25, the Day Out of Time, a day to practice time is art and peace through culture. Its daily use helps entrain the mind into the threshold of galactic consciousness. The 13 Moon/28-day calendar embraces and synchronizes all true calendrical and mathematical systems, from lunar calendars, to the Mayan long count, to the Elder Futhark runes, to the I Ching hexagrams. In other words, this system reveals a master matrix, which contains all other systems.
In the Gregorian calendar there is little cyclic or periodic order. Months are uneven; the length of months does not correlate with number of seven-day weeks, and the numbers change every month. https://lawoftime.org/education/

"One people, one Earth, one Time": "The times we are living in require higher thinking. There has never in the history of the Earth been a time like this. We are now participating in what is called the biosphere-noosphere transition. "Only by lifting our minds to planetary consciousness and beyond can we realize solutions to the multiple challenges facing our planet today. With a new consciousness we can effectively educate and mobilize humanity to an unprecedented level of creative problem solving and realize a positive future." Source: http://lawoftime.org

SPACE THE FINAL FRONTIER: Reuse of DARPA - NATO's structured data exchange that maps data element OPSCODES to symbol sets is key to Artificial Intelligence #AI man - machine interface, consensus, consistency among myriad #blockchain programmable #money memes, metaphors... Given space travel risks, navigation based on consciousness / telepathy (use of symbols not words), a consistent syntax lexicon to communicate with #UFO EBO's that are likely Artificial Intelligence AI drones is reuse of DARPA - NATO's structured data exchange that maps data element OPSCODES to symbol sets. Trade with E.T. / EBO’s (will) requires a consistent supply chain lexicon
The Heart Beacon Cycle Time – Space Meter: One method fits many not one size fits all.

SUMMARY: The Heart Beacon Cycle Time  - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an adaptive procedural template / checklist of ideas, methods, processes, procedures, algorithms, tools… used to organize a system of federated systems comprised of diverse groups, people speaking many different languages through the universal language of symbols into Distributed Autonomous groups organized in time - space to achieve common goals such as establishing an Ecologically sustainable Economic heartbeat. This method involves reuse of over 300 use cases supported by hundreds of message sets further described in spread sheet row - column format populated by thousands of brevity OPSCODES mapped to symbols essential to artificial intelligence man - machine interface. NATO bases are small cities that transact virtually every good, item, commodity with the host nation. Why reinvent the syntax lexicon Rosetta Stone wheel?
