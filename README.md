VISION STATEMENT: Currency inflation / wars.. Economic reset - what's the plan ?

1, SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

USPTO 13/573,002 The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space Meter = Patent type: Adaptive Procedural Template Framework: checklist: ideas, algorithms, processes, procedures, metrics, meters, signal & telemetry structured data for consistent Eco sustainable economic time cycle epochs for programmable $ / economy / Net, Net of Money Foundation Technology for DeFi, programmable internet of money / Web 3.0

USPTO 13/573,002 framework supports for example, Distributed Trade Federation Organizations with DoD / NATO system of systems engineering signaling, telemetry engineering, syntax OPSCODE brevity codes matched with 2525C symbol sets vital for A.I. man-machine interface, interoperability, consistency, spatial – temporal consensus.

Question: what constitutes foundation tech for #DeFi / programmable $$$ ? Teams are forming to win the DeFi Distributed Finance / programmable $$$ - money IP Intellectual Property wars. The winning team will prove that their IP intellectual property filings establishes / established foundation technology. What is foundation technology given the SCOTUS 2014 "Alice in Wonderland" ruling? The internet and now the internet of money Web 3.0 is described with memes, metaphors, made up words. 

THESIS: All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:
1.	Time epochs created by oscillating quartz crystal silicon chips
2.	Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles

All things internet, internet of money, blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast protocols. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Blockchains are formed by unicast, multicast, anycast and workflow filters. Programmable money’s improvements are in cryptography. Web 3.0 is based on the original internet TCP/IP structure that has not changed because it cannot change. 

Statement: there are no packets, frames, layers, blocks, shards, graphs, hash graphs “bots”, “motes”, … or Satoshi's traversing the net, stored in a blockchain cube. Transactions are unicast, multicast, or anycast (workflow). The afore mention terms are non-existent, fictitious, imaginary metaphorical fabrications that are non - compliant with US Supreme Court SCOTUS Alice Corp Vs CLS Bank 2014 ruling “claims may not direct towards abstract ideas”. Physical is the opposite of abstract.
 
Nobel Prize winning Economist Milton Friedman “only a crisis brings real change” 

Nobel Prize Winning Economist Milton Friedman: “Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.” ― Milton Friedman

PURPOSE: Provide signaling, telemetry, data element syntax lexicon support for economist Milton Friedman’s K% rule where a FEDCOIN / WORLDCOIN currency is supported from sampling lead economic indicators i.e., commodity RWA Real World Assets measurable, tangible, tokenized assets across a universal event bus applying the firefly-heartbeat algorithm tracking changes, updating q statistical mean value index. Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman described an "economic heartbeat" in his K% rule where the Treasury increases the money supply increases and decreases pegged to increases, decreases in GDP index volume.

PURPOSE: Climate change impact on food production: given food, fertilizer shortages (wheat, sunflower, soybean...), energy, fuel prices and looming fuel rationing, it logically follows that the world has no other options than to organize both micro (local) and macro (global) economies observing space - time conservative SLA Service Level Agreements where closer = cheaper given closer = less fuel, C02, time resources used to produce, ship.. Demurrage fees incentivize conservation of resources, commodities i.e., discounts for locally produced, consumed goods and commodities. It is TIME.

9.	Distributed Autonomous Organization DAO: created by a military think tank RAND Corporation circa 2001. This term is being reused by organizations describing cryptocurrency blockchain technology. USPTO 13,573,002’s method is protocol, technology neutral. Use cases focus on the cryptocurrency blockchain. For example, many message oriented middleware products use message event bus strategies. USPTO 13/573,002 reuses and improves upon military Network Centric Warfare best practice of organizing individuals in groups geo-spatially distributed across distances and UTZ time zones i.e., micro – macro cycle scheduling, use of organizational, resource identifiers via structured data exchanges is reused / improved through use of algorithms which are essentially workflow rules and math for example. 

10.	Adaptive Procedural Template = checklist of useful tools, procedures. Use adaptive, procedural templates to aid individuals join trade federations. Affiliated organizations are geo-spatially, temporally located in distributed, dispersed locations across time – space. Member organizations may join or leave in an adhoc, agile manner to take advantage or react to events, situations while retaining autonomy or the ability to act on one’s own behalf, control one’s own activities, The process involves agile, adhoc joins, merges, drops to / from federation in lieu of formal merger, and acquisition Trade federations form among local communities or among sovereign (First) nations. The off-site connector workflow object convention connects, mitigates, adjusts by summation, statistical mean by aggregation among federated, non-federated groups acting as format gateways among participating, non – participating groups.
