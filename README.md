Eco_Econ_Epochs: It's about TIME

All things internet, internet of programmable money are formed using:

1) Time epochs created by oscillating crystal based silicon chips

2) Syntax used / not used as programming instructions during epoch time cycles

Time epochs / syntax: two main building blocks in creating the Artificial Intelligence A.I. powered global economic system of systems / Earth Intelligence Network EIN / Web 3.0 and the programmable economy in terms of temporal consistency, interoperability, and consensus.

Eco incentives coded into the global programmable economic system of systems engineering framework based on NATO best practice into OPSCODE brevity codes mapped to symbol sets essential to Artificial Intelligence / human interaction along with OPTEMPO sync cycles. NATO forces have invested 30 years of mapping OPSCODE brevity codes to symbol sets contained in 300 plus message set use cases as part of Battlefield digitization, Net Centric Warfare NET Enabled Operations NETOPS - why would blockchain, crypto currency developers recreate, reinvent this wheel? 

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time‚Ää - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an adaptive procedural template / checklist of ideas, methods, processes, procedures, algorithms, tools‚Ä¶ used to organize diverse peoples speaking many different languages through the universal language of symbols into Distributed Autonomous groups organized in time - space to achieve common goals such as establishing an Ecologically sustainable Economic heartbeat. 

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time‚Ää - Space Meter USPTO 13/573,002 is an adaptive procedural template / checklist of ideas, methods, processes, procedures, algorithms, tools‚Ä¶ used to organize diverse peoples speaking many different languages through the universal language of symbols into Distributed Autonomous groups organized in time - space to achieve common goals such as establishing an Ecologically sustainable Economic heartbeat. This idea involves reuse of over 300 use cases supported by hundreds of message sets further described in spread sheet row - column format populated by thousands of brevity OPSCODES mapped to symbols essential to artificial intelligence man - machine interface.  NATO bases are small cities that transact virtually every good, item, commodity with it's host nation.  Why reinvent the syntax lexicon Rosetta Stone wheel? Think of this as a system of systems tool to accelerate an EIN Earth Intelligence Net

The Heart Beacon Cycle Time - Space meter is a signaling, telemetry distributed systems engineering framework improving temporal, geo-spatial, semantic - syntactic sync & consensus among DAAE Distributed Autonomous Automated Economy system of systems reusing Battlefield Digitization, Net Enabled Operations engineering swords to plowshares.

Eco sustainable incentives integral to an Economic system of systems SoS engineering framework used by NATO for decades. Digital Nations need an (Eco sustainable) Economic Heartbeat & a consistent syntax lexicon libraryüòç

Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN see Robert David Steele‚Äôs #UNRIG proposal @ http://robertdavidsteele.com

Economic #RESET is a mathematical certainty. Do we RESET the global system of systems as is or will we re-engineer using NATO system of systems engineering framework standing on the shoulders of giants to convert swords to plowshares?

Eco Economic Heartbeat: It‚Äôs TIME: IF Climate Change causes a drop in crop commodity food production by 20‚Äì25 % while population continues to grow, THEN it follows that this condition will become a matter of national security. It‚Äôs TIME to implement an Ecologically Sustainable Economic Heartbeat ELSE face > greater chaos by not leveraging proven system of system structured data exchange methods.

IF climate change causes a drop in crop commodity by 20‚Äì25 % while population grows, THEN this condition will become a matter of national security. THEN this will require revisiting Belgian Economist Bernard Lietaer‚Äôs TRC Trade Reference Currency ELSE face > chaos LINK http://lietaer.com/2010/01/terra/ If, when climate change reduces crop commodity production while population continues to rise, it follows that this could become a National Security issue ‚Äî then, an ecologically sustainable economic heartbeat would be obviously needed. Why wait until crisis, DEFCON 2 stage?

Ecologically sustainable economic transactions need to be incentivized among the world‚Äôs Ecological and Economic system of systems. The world‚Äôs systems need to be time-space synchronized, stochastically harmonized across the UTZ Universal Time Zone via heartbeat messages composed with OPSCODE brevity codes drawn from a universal structured data exchange syntax lexicon with over 300 use case templates.

System of Systems Framework: Crypto economics needs a universal syntax lexicon digital base Artificial Intelligence A.I., quantum blockchain heartbeat beacon to synchronize, sample tokenized commodities across a stochastically harmonized UTZ Universal Time Zone supporting an Earth Intelligence Network EIN. Is it time to build a new economic system of systems framework yet? Why wait for DEFCON Level 2 to start a system of systems sustainable project? All things #internet, net of #money #blockchain #cryptocurrencies rely on unicast, multicast ‚Äî like DoD / NATO‚Äôs #DAO Distributed Autonomous Organization system of systems ‚Äî a term coined by the RAND Corporation circa 2000. Programmable money‚Äôs improvements are in cryptography

Nobel Prize winning Economist Milton Friedman‚Äôs K% rule is what I call an ‚Äúeconomic heartbeat‚Äù K-Percent Rule. DEFINITION of ‚ÄòK-Percent Rule‚Äô. The K-Percent Rule was a proposal by economist Milton Friedman that the central bank should increase the money supply by a constant percentage every year. The K-Percent Rule proposes to set the money supply growth at a rate equal to the growth of real GDP each year. K-Percent Rule ‚Äî Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/k-percent-rule.asp

Internet, Internet of Money config: HEARTBEAT SCOP Administrative Interface ‚Äî configuring the internet, internet of money. SCOP is a tool that exemplifies how the internet really works. There are no levels, layers, packets, frames‚Ä¶ etc. There are only epoch time cycles used / not used to parse, process syntax as instructions. Scaling the blockchain usually involves a discussion of ‚Äúlayers‚Äù when the reality is that parsing, processing syntax (OPSCODE brevity codes, shards, hashes) is passed from the genesis Epoch Time Cycle 1 to a temporal follow on epoch time cycle.

Q: Why do the Artificial Intelligence AND the programmable money.. communities insist there are "layers" (motes, bits, bytes, block chain blocks, pings, packets...) when there are only 1) epoch time intervals, 2) syntax used as if, then, else instructions?
